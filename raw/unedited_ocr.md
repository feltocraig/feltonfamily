# 1633 — 1935

This volume owes its existence to my finding a copy of the “Felton Family” compiled by Cyrus Felton, of Marlboro, Massachusetts, and published in 1886. This book, found in a collection from our old home library, had many marginal notations placed there by my father years ago. These notes pertaining to Feltons were evidently taken from the press of the day. My curiosity became aroused as to where and what had become of the hosts recorded in the Cyrus Felton book and those who have arrived upon the scene during the intervening forty-seven years.

In the latter part of 1929, I wrote letters to several of the villages mentioned as the homes of Feltons at the time the book was published. I received a few answers either from some recorded member or, more often, from some descendant. Other batches of letters were mailed from time to time with like results. After several months of this research, the habit became fixed and I boldly set out to bring the genealogy down to date.

Practically all of this history has been compiled through correspondence. I have made a few short trips in search of data. In August of this year Mrs. Felton and I with our daughter Peggy drove to Salem, Massachusetts, via Washington, D. C. returning through New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York. We visited many of the homes of our ancestors and collected some interesting history and pictures which appear in this volume. The history is not complete—genealogies never are. That there are errors is granted. However, I herewith offer this brief three hundred years history of Nathaniel Felton and his descendants in America. The interesting introduction “The English Felton History” has been compiled and is generously contributed by Mr. Edgar Conway Felton, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to whom all Feltons of our line should feel deeply indebted.

# OUR ENGLISH ANCESTORS

The official Records of Salem and of the Massachusetts Bay Colony tell us that the Feltons arriving in the Bay Colony between 1630 and 1635 were Eleanor or Ellen, a widow, who is also referred to as “Mistress” Felton, a title of considerable distinction in that day, Benjamin and his wife Mary, Nathaniel, Judith and Margaret. They were related in this way. Benjamin in Savage’s “Genealogical Dictionary of the First Settlers of New England” is stated to have been Ellen’s son, but no authority has been found for this statement. An entry in Ralph Fogg’s “Waste Book,” the oldest of the original records at Salem says in so many words that Nathaniel was Ellen’s son. Judith and Margaret were Nathaniel’s sisters in the wills of their respective husbands, John Ingersoll and Christopher Waller, each appoints his brother-in-law, Nathaniel Felton, as Overseer. The exact date of their coming and the name of the ship on which they crossed the Atlantic is not known. Nathaniel in his deposition of 6 April, 1705, states that he had then been in Salem seventy two years and thus fixes the year of his arrival as 1633. Benjamin was at Salem at least as early as September 1635 when the General Court of Massachusetts Bay ordered Robert Scarlet his servant to be whipped for running away from his master. Grants of land were made to Ellen Felton and to Benjamin in 1636. Savage without giving his authority states that Nathaniel came to Salem in 1633, returned home in the next year and came again in 1635. What probably happened was that Nathaniel then a young man of about eighteen came to Salem in 1633, and after looking into conditions there recrossed the ocean and sometime in 1635 returned to Salem with the other members of the family. Benjamin in a deposition made 11 August, 1668 states that he was then sixty four years of age. This makes the year of his birth 1604. Nathaniel was born in 1615 or 1616 as is shown by numerous depositions of his.

12 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

Besides these six individuals, Savage mentions a John Felton as being a settler at Lynn, but the date given for this John's having been made a Freeman, 1680, identifies him as the oldest son of our ancestor, Nathaniel. Cyrus Felton in his excellent genealogy of our family says that the John Felton noted in Hotten's "History of Persons of Quality Who Went From Great Britian to the American Plantations 1600-1700" as being in the West Indian island of Barbadoes in 1680, was a settler at Salem or Lynn. If in New England, at all, this John of Barbadoes did not remain. What was found in regard to him will be given later.

A search for the English home of these Salem Feltons was begun in the early part of 1888. At the outset it seemed more than probable that they were near relatives of that John Felton who in August, 1628, had assassinated the Duke of Buckingham at Portsmouth. The fact that the assassin's mother was a widow named Eleanor and that Benjamin and Nathaniel had each named a son John, coupled with the ardent Puritanism of the assassin all pointed to the likelihood of such a relationship. Accordingly, the family history of this John Felton and his mother, Eleanor, were investigated. Much was found in regard to mother and son in print and in the unpublished papers preserved in the English Archives. John proved to be a blood relation on his father's side of the noble family of Arundel. His mother, Eleanor, was a daughter of William Wright at one time Mayor of Durham, and among the Bishop of London's marriage licenses was found a license granted 31 January, 1578-9 to Thomas Felton, Gentleman, and Eleanor Wright, Spinster of St. Bride's, Fleet Street to marry there. Eleanor's will was dated 1 February, 1637-8 and was proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury 21 September, 1638. In it she describes herself as the widow of Thomas Felton and makes bequests to two married daughters and to her son Edmund who had a son, Nicholas, and a daughter, Catharine. This will of Eleanor proves that she died in 1638 in London. At that time our Eleanor was living in Salem on the other side of the Atlantic where she sold land in 1652 and where William Lord in his will of 1668 made a bequest to "Mistress" Felton who could have been none other than our ancestress.

# THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

Any near relationship between our Salem Feltons and the assassin, John Felton, was in this way disproved. Soon after this the will of a John Felton, Beer Brewer, of Great Yarmouth in Norfolk was found in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury. It was dated 2 March, 1626-7 and was proved on the 11th of the following June, and directs that after the payment of his debts the residue of his estate is to go to his wife Ellen, and is to be used for her maintenance and for the bringing up of his children, none of whom are mentioned by name. This discovery opened up so promising a field of investigation that it was immediately followed by an examination of the Parish Registers of the Church of St. Nicholas at Great Yarmouth. Here were found recorded the marriage of John Felton and Ellen Thrower 22 April 1612, the burial of John 17 March 1626-7, and the baptisms of their seven children, among whom were a son, Nathaniel, and two daughters, Judith and Margaret. Nathaniel was baptized 10 May, 1615, the year in which his depositions made at Salem indicate that he was born. Benjamin was baptized 19 December, 1604, which was also the year his Salem deposition shows to have been that of his birth. He proved to be a younger brother of John the Brewer, and, therefore, the uncle and not the brother of the younger emigrants. His marriage to Mary Story 2 September, 1628, was also found on the Parish Registers of St. Nicholas and furnished additional proof, if any was needed, as to the identity of the Great Yarmouth and Salem families. 

The English home of our Feltons being thus definitely established at Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, all available records there and in the vicinity were examined and from the data thus obtained the direct line of the younger Felton emigrants to Salem was carried back through their father, John the Brewer, his father, John the Younger, his father, John the Elder to their great, great grandparents, Robert Felton and his wife, Margaret. The reason for giving Ellen Felton the title of “Mistress” on her arrival at Salem was now made clear. She proved to be the granddaughter of one Bailiff or Mayor of Great Yarmouth and the sister of another, while her husband was the grandson of John Felton who was three times chosen Bailiff and who represented the Borough.

14 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

in two of Queen Elizabeth’s Parliaments, and the nephew of Nicholas Felton, Bishop of Ely and Master of Pembroke Hall at Cambridge.  
First and most important among the records examined were the Registers of St. Nicholas, the Parish Church of Great Yarmouth. These begin in 1558 the year in which by Act of Parliament all future baptisms, marriages and burials were required to be recorded. Next the municipal records of the Town were searched. In the Assembly Books which contain the minutes of the meetings of the Corporation many references were found to our Feltons and to persons related to them by marriage or otherwise. The Court Rolls on which every suit at law brought within the Borough and many deeds are entered were gone over for the period when our Feltons were living at Great Yarmouth. All miscellaneous records of the Town, and there are many, were searched also for anything throwing light on our family history. Next the three East Anglian Registries at Norwich, Ipswich and Bury St. Edmunds, as well as that of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury at London were examined for Felton wills and those of allied families. The records of Chancery Proceedings and a vast number of miscellaneous Archives were also searched for any promising entries. In all cases full verbatim copies or abstracts covering all important facts were taken.  
It is a very happy circumstance that we have a history of Great Yarmouth finished in 1619, describing the town and what went on there at the very time when our Feltons were living within its ancient walls. The author of this History was Henry Manship, a one time Clerk of the Corporation and a contemporary and friend of our ancestor, John Felton the Elder, whose will he witnessed, and whose achievements he praises. Manship’s work existed in manuscript until 1853 when it was printed with copious notes by Charles John Palmer, F. S. A. a native of Great Yarmouth and a life long student of its history and antiquities. Between 1872 and 1875 Mr. Palmer published his “Perlustration of Great Yarmouth” in three volumes, in which he describes the ancient Town street by street and almost house by house, with a marvelous wealth of illustrative material taken from ancient

# THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

sources. All of Mr. Palmer's volumes should be read and studied by those of the Felton name who would like to have a clear picture and understanding of the Great Yarmouth of their English forebears.

The first mention of Robert Felton our earliest English ancestor so far discovered was found on the Great Yarmouth Court Rolls for the 11th year of Henry VIII, 1519-1520. He is there described as the servant, or as we would now call him the apprentice of Robert Crask. This shows that he was then serving an apprenticeship so that he might become a freeman or burgess of the Borough. This record is important because it indicates that Robert's father was not a citizen of Great Yarmouth otherwise the son would not have been obliged to serve an apprenticeship but would have become a Freeman in right of his father. It implies, therefore, that Robert was not a native of Great Yarmouth but had probably come from one of the nearby counties and was planning to begin his career in the town which at that time was one of the most thriving seaports of England.

There are not many other references to Robert on the Court Rolls. He was a juror in 1529, 1531 and 1541 and several minor and unimportant suits were brought against him or by him. In October, 1540, he became surety for one Robert Halys and is then designated "mariner." The Great Yarmouth Assembly Books show that 7 October 1555 he brought a suit of attachment against one Robert Ives in the Admiralty Court when a verdict was rendered in his favor. The Parish Registers of St. Nicholas Church begin in 1558, and in the very next year record Robert's burial 24 August, 1559. His will was found in the Registry of the neighboring Archdeaconry Court of Norwich. It is dated 1 December, 1558 and was proved 26 January 1559-60. In it he describes himself as of Great Yarmouth in the county of Norfolk, Mariner, and bequeaths to his wife, Margaret, two tenements in Great Yarmouth in one of which he dwelt. His wife is also to have a part of his herring and mackerel nets. His son, John, is to receive his crare or fishing boat besides some fish nets. His daughter, Margaret, also receives some nets and ten pounds which his wife is to pay to her within a year after his death. His wife, Margaret, 

16 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

who is made sole Executrix is to have the entire residue of the estate. She survived her husband for some eight years and was buried 5 March, 1566-7 in the Churchyard of Great Yarmouth as she requests in her will which was found in the Registry at Norwich. It was dated 16 February, 1566-7, and was proved 11 April following. It is a truly admirable document and between the lines we can read what a dear old lady this first English ancestress of ours must have been. No one among her relatives, friends or servants is overlooked. She begins by making gifts to her Church and its curates and to the Morning Prayer which later her Puritan son continued to foster and maintain. Money was to be distributed to the very poor at her funeral. Every servant, not only her own, but those of her son-in-law and son are remembered. All her working raiment is to be distributed among the poor women of Great Yarmouth. Of her immediate family, first comes “Mine own daughter, Margaret” and her husband John Skorch and their daughter Thomasine. The Skorches received the bulk of the estate including the two tenements she had received from her husband, but out of the income derived from them they are to pay ten pounds to the three children of her son, John when they reach the age of eighteen. These Felton grandchildren are John, Dionis and Nicholas, and beside the money, the boys are each given a herring and mackerel net and their sister, Dionis, who is evidently a great favorite of her grandmother, is to receive a mark in money and a pewter platter such as was given to her cousin, Thomasine Skorch. Margaret, the wife of her son, John, is also mentioned and remembered. Her son-in-law, John Skorch, is appointed executor and her son, John, is to help him in carrying out the provisions of the will. Thomas Conyers, “our Curate,” is one of the witnesses. From this will it is evident that her two children, Margaret and John had been married since their father’s death in 1559. The will of her son-in-law, John Skorch, was found in the Registry at Norwich where it was proved 16 September, 1607. His burial is recorded on the Parish Register 21 July in the same year. To his well beloved wife, Margaret, he leaves everything and she is appointed sole executrix. John Skorch describes himself as a cordwainer. He was evidently a

THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

a man of substance and good standing, for he was one of the Church Wardens in 1578 and in other years, and in 1592, is named by the Assembly as custodian of one of the keys of "The Hutch" the chest in which the Borough Archives were kept.  
The head of the Great Yarmouth family in the second generation was John, the son of Robert and Margaret. For convenience he will be designated as John the Elder to distinguish him from his son and grandson of the same name. His marriage to Margaret Manning is recorded on the Parish Register 15 September, 1559, the year in which England’s great Queen Elizabeth ascended the throne. The year of John’s birth was not found. He was born before the Registry of Baptisms was made obligatory, nor was the parentage of his wife, Margaret Manning, discovered. Her family was a well-known one at this period in Great Yarmouth and the neighboring counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. That she had two sisters is shown by a deed found on the Court Rolls and dated 21 January, 1594-5, in which John Gross the Elder of Great Yarmouth, Merchant, and Dionis his wife, John Felton the Elder of Great Yarmouth, Merchant, and Margaret his wife, and John Harris of Great Yarmouth, Merchant, and Judith his wife, conveyed a certain piece of land in Great Yarmouth to one Emma Goose. This indicates that the three wives were sisters and were jointly interested in the land conveyed. A confirmation of this relationship is to be found in the will of John the Elder’s second son, Nicholas, Bishop of Ely who in it mentions a cousin Harris. The Grosses were not only relatives but close friends of John and Margaret as is evidenced by many items appearing in wills and other records.  
John and Margaret’s oldest child was a son, John, who was baptized 4 August 1560 and it is through him that the direct line of our Salem Feltons descends. Their second child was a daughter, Dionis, who was baptized 11 January, 1561-2. She married John Gross, a nephew of John Gross the Elder mentioned in the deed of 1594-5, and her children are mentioned frequently in the family papers. The third child of John and Margaret was a second son, Nicholas, who was baptized 3 August, 1563. His distinguished career

18 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

as a scholar and divine in the reigns of Elizabeth, James I and Charles I will be referred to later. In all twelve children of John and Margaret were baptized at St. Nicholas Church, but of these only the three already mentioned and another son, Daniel, who was baptized 18 February, 1571-2, appear to have lived to maturity.

The elder John Felton’s public services began in 1564 when he was appointed to be one of the “Forty-Eights,” the junior group in the Borough Corporation which in later years became the Common Council. As one of the “Forty-Eights,” he now attended all the meetings or Assemblies of the Corporation which was composed of the “Forty-Eights,” the “Twenty-Fours” known in later times as the Aldermen, and the Borough Executives chosen each year. Almost immediately upon his becoming a member of the Corporation he was, to quote from the Assembly Books, “appointed with others to go unto Kirkley Roads to fetch and gather anchorage according to an old ancient custom.” It is worth noting that this the first duty assigned him had to do with the troublesome question of collecting dues from ships at anchor in Kirkley Roads, and that his last recorded service was also to be concerned with this same vexatious subject. In December of this year, 1564, he is named as one of a small committee to examine the Haven and report as to the work required to make it safe. The Haven or Harbor of Great Yarmouth was a never ending source of anxiety and expense to its citizens. Its care and preservation was the subject of almost yearly mention on the Assembly Books and our ancestor, the elder John Felton was frequently called upon for advice in regard to it. Later on he was several times appointed Master of the Haven Works. In September, 1565, he is named one of a Committee to draft articles to be sent to the Burgesses representing the Borough in the Parliament then sitting at Westminster, advising them as to the action they should take in respect to measures then before the House of Commons. This would seem a very responsible duty to assign to one who had become a member of the Corporation only two years before. In February 1569-70 he with others were appointed to employ workmen to construct a quay along the South Mount,

# The Feltons in England and America

one of the principal defenses of Great Yarmouth, the base of which was evidently being undermined by the action of the Harbor tides.

Our ancestor’s advancement to important offices in the Borough was rapid and at the election of Town officials held on St. John’s Day in 1570 he was chosen one of the Chamberlains. The Chamberlains were second in dignity and importance only to the Bailiffs or Mayors of the Town and in the Church they sat at the head of the gallery assigned to the “Forty-Eights” just as the Bailiffs sat in the gallery opposite where the “Twenty-Fours” were seated. The Chamberlain’s duties combined those of Treasurer and Chief Accountant. They received all the rents, fines and customs paid into the Borough Treasury and accounted for the disposition of the same. For their many services they were allowed twenty shillings per annum. In this year the elder John purchased the house which was to be his home for the rest of his life. This was a property belonging to the Borough and known as “Gregory’s” and for it he agreed to pay four score pounds, a very considerable sum for that time, forty pounds down and ten pounds yearly until the entire debt was paid. His sureties were Mr. Gross and Mr. Fenn. John Gross was an intimate friend and related to him by marriage, and Nicholas Fenn was twice chosen Bailiff and also represented Great Yarmouth in the House of Commons. Gregory’s was located in the South Leet or Ward of Great Yarmouth and it was in this part of the town that the elder John, his son and grandson lived. It is more than likely that the exact location of his house could be determined today, for it is described as fronting to the East on MIddlegate Street and between certain common lanes or “rows” and the land of John Thrower to the South. John Thrower as will be seen later was the grandfather of Ellen Thrower who, as the Widow Felton, accompanied her children to Salem. An example of the regard in which our ancestor was held is shown by his appointment about this time as one of a committee to revise the ancient ordinances and statutes of the Borough which had become antiquated or obsolete. The importance of this Committee is indicated by the men who were its members. They constituted a group which appears

20  THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

again and again upon the records as dominating the affairs of the Borough.

After serving in all the other important offices in the Corporation, John Felton was in 1576 chosen to the highest position in the gift of his fellow townsmen, that of Bailiff. Thomas Echard who had been elected Junior Bailiff for this year, shortly after being inducted into office, died of the plague, that dreadful scourge which swept over Europe at intervals during the sixteenth century and each time took a fearful toll of the inhabitants of Great Yarmouth. The Assembly Books have this to say under date of 29 October, 1576, “At this Assembly after the decease of Mr. Bailiff Echard, John Felton was chosen in his stead by the whole jury except one man which was John Wyllesey, and the same John Felton took his oath of Bailiff in the same Assembly.” What the reason was which influenced Wyllesey to cast his vote against our ancestor does not appear. The Bailiffs were the Chief Executives of the Borough. The Senior of the two, or Prime Bailiff as he was called, was the head official of the Town, the Junior Bailiff, who was now John Felton, acting as his assistant and assuming his duties during his absence or inability to serve. The Bailiffs under the ancient Charter of Great Yarmouth were originally four in number, one being chosen probably to represent each of the four Leets or Wards. In 1426, their number was reduced to two and this continued during the years when our Feltons were living at Great Yarmouth and until 1681 when by the Charter of Charles II a single Mayor took the place of the two Bailiffs. Their duties were quite burdensome. Together they sat as judges at the weekly sessions of the Borough Court. They also presided at the meetings of the Assembly and managed all the internal affairs of the Borough, besides representing the town on all public occasions and receiving and entertaining all visitors of note. They acted too as clerks of the market and held court on each market day at the Market Cross. Their official robes were carefully specified and fines were imposed for every failure to appear in the prescribed dress. By the ordinance of 1541 which was in effect in John Felton’s time the Bailiffs and all those who had been Bailiffs were ordered to wear their official

# The Feltons in England and America

robes consisting of gowns of scarlet furred, with tippets and doublets of velvet, on all principal festivals and in this dress they sat at the head of the gallery in the Church reserved for the "Twenty Fours." Their wives were by ordinance directed to wear velvet hats on all festivals, a headdress which was forbidden to all other women. The meetings of the Corporation over which the Bailiffs presided were held in the Guild Hall behind closed doors and anyone betraying the confidences of these meetings was fined and in aggravated cases was dismissed from the Corporation.

One of the picturesque and interesting duties the Bailiffs performed had to do with an excursion which they made annually upon the fresh water streams flowing into the Haven of Great Yarmouth. This journey on the water was taken for the purpose of maintaining the ancient rights which the Borough had possessed upon these rivers from time immemorial. Manship has this to say about these ceremonies, “And to the end that good order may be in and by the same water liberties the better preserved the Bailiffs for the time being two several days in the year with many of their ancient brethren and others of the Society, the inquest of liberties, musicians and other officials on them attending, with banners and ensigns displayed, sometimes with sounds of trumpets, beating of drums, playing of fifes and other whiles sweetly singing, do pass on these waters.” On their return from this annual excursion “the Bailiffs do with great applause of the people and shooting of ordnance set foot on land again at Yarmouth, each Bailiff taking his company with him where if any cheer in their boats upon the waters was wanting at dinner the same at their houses be largely supplied at supper.”

But by far the most interesting and unique of the duties performed by the Yarmouth Bailiffs was that of presiding jointly with the two Bailiffs of the Cinque Ports, at what was known as the Free Fair Court which lasted for the forty days of the annual herring fishery. The Cinque Ports were the ancient towns on the east Coast of England in the vicinity of the Straits of Dover, which before Great Yarmouth existed had monopolized the fisheries and the traffic of England with the Low Countries and the ports of France. As Yarmouth grew in importance and its people became increasingly

22 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

interested in this trade, frequent quarrels arose between the citizens and authorities of the Cinque Ports and those of Great Yarmouth. The former claimed a right to control affairs in Great Yarmouth during the important days of the herring fishery. This claim brought on frequent bitter and bloody fights at sea between the men of Yarmouth and those of the Cinque Ports. On one occasion during the reign of Edward I when that monarch was passing over seas to aid the Earl of Flanders against the French, in the very presence of the King a savage fight took place between the sailors of Yarmouth and the Portmen in which, according to Hollingshead, twenty five ships were burned and almost two hundred men were killed, and in later years during an altercation in the streets of the Town one of the Cinque Port Bailiffs was stabbed to death by a Yarmouth Bailiff. To put an end to this intolerable strife the device of the Joint Court during the Free Fair was put into effect and for these forty days the Bailiffs of Great Yarmouth and the two Bailiffs chosen by the Cinque Ports presided together over the affairs of Great Yarmouth. The ceremonies observed on these occasions in which John Felton took a principal part during his three terms as Bailiff are described in Manship’s History. While the fights and bloodshed of former times had disappeared many disputes and bickerings as to precedence and procedure continued in John Felton’s day, accounts of which may be found in Palmer’s “Perlustration.”

Immediately after his first term as Bailiff our ancestor’s rides to London on the business of the Borough began. These visits to the Capital brought him in touch with the members of the Privy Council and the leading men of Queen Elizabeth’s cabinet. For the ensuing years he seems to have been regularly chosen to conduct all negotiations in behalf of the Town with the authorities in London. On his return from one of these visits in 1577 the Assembly Books record that he had appeared before the Admiralty Court, and in return for the Judge’s promise not to interfere with the Town’s Admiralty Jurisdiction had agreed that the Judge should receive yearly during his lifetime a barrel of Yarmouth herrings. At the same time other gifts of Yarmouth products were made to various officials and itemized on the records as

# THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

Lenten provisions for 1577. Among the officials thus favored were the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, the Master of the Rolls and the Secretary of State. This is an interesting illustration of the practices, considered proper and honorable in negotiating with Government officials in the reign of Good Queen Bess. These rides to London continued year after year and the various items of business entrusted to our ancestor are fully set forth on the Assembly Books at Great Yarmouth.

At the annual election held in 1585 “Mister” Felton, and after his election to the office of Bailiff his name always appears thus on the Great Yarmouth Assembly Books, was again chosen Bailiff. On his second election he became Senior or Prime Bailiff and the chief executive of the Borough. In April of his second term, there is an entry on the minutes of the Assembly which brings before us the hazzards to which the fishing boats of Great Yarmouth were exposed on the high seas because of the piratical craft frequenting their fishing grounds. To guard the fishing boats the Assembly now arranged to employ Mr. Bailiff Felton’s ship for “wafting,” or convoying and protecting the mackerel boats during the approaching fishing season. Under the arrangement entered into, the owner was to receive as rental twenty pounds per month and five pounds additional toward the expenses of fitting out his ship. He also was to take the risk of his ship and to provide ordnance for her. During her employment John Some was to be Captain and John Felton, Junior, Master. In the following June, the services of Mister Felton’s ship were dispensed with, the minutes of the Assembly reading “The House considering the great charges of the ship set forth for wafting the North Seamen (being now come home into the Roads) and hoping that the fishermen should not now have so great need of wafting (the most part of the North Seamen being already thanked be God safely come home) have therefore agreed that the said ship should be discharged and the whole company dismissed and set at liberty from that service excepting the persons following who must see to it the victuals, ordnance, shot and powder and such like things be safely looked to and so laid up in some good and convenient place to the use of

the Town.” Among those named to look after the ship’s supplies was John Felton, Junior.

And now we come to the most important of the services rendered to his native town by our ancestor. In the spring of 1588 after many years of preparation the widely heralded Spanish Armada was about to set sail from Lisbon for the invasion and conquest of England. The importance of Great Yarmouth in this crisis can hardly be exaggerated. The town possessed the safest and most commodious harbor on the English coast north of the Straits of Dover and the mouth of the River Thames and with the port in possession of an enemy an easy and direct road was open for a hostile army’s march upon the nation’s capital. During the first three months of this year our ancestor had ridden to London at least three times on important business for the Town; had made trips to consult with the Lords Lieutenant of the Counties of Norfolk and Suffolk and the Lord High Admiral, for the purpose of arranging for the defense of the Town and of its fishing fleets. It is little wonder that in connection with his final journey to London the Corporation made this entry upon its minutes, “Mr. Felton being already travailed in divers of the Town’s causes at London was again entreated and by the House authorized to ride to London” where he was to deliver important letters to the Privy Council. “And also” the minute concludes “he shall buy a last of powder to be sent down presently.”

What happened to the Spanish Armada is a matter of history, but our ancestor’s part in arranging for the defense of Great Yarmouth and the coasts thereabouts is something of which his descendants may well be proud. When all danger of the Spanish invasion was at an end, what remained of the monies received by the Town from the Government and the nearby Counties was turned over to Mr. Felton and was doubtless to be expended by him as Master of the Haven Works for the improvement of the Harbor.

Year after year, the Assembly Books record his rides to London to appear before the Privy Council on the Town’s business. In August 1590 he had evidently suffered some very considerable losses, for the Assembly Books contain this minute—“At this Assembly the House pitying and

# The Feltons in England and America

lamenting the losses of Mr. John Felton have upon consideration of the said losses and the great pains and industries he in times past hath bestowed in the Town's affairs for the good of the Town in most faithful manner, for his small relief granted unto him to have the Town's part of four Hosts by the space of four years now next ensuing." Host was the name given at Great Yarmouth to the masters of fishing boats not owned by citizens of the Town. Each Host was assigned to a citizen through whom alone the Host's fish could be sold, one half of the profit going to the citizen and one half to the Town. Nothing is disclosed as to the nature of this misfortune. The elder John's whole fortune was no doubt invested in ships and fishing boats and probably some disaster at sea or raid by pirates was the cause of his temporary undoing. The Records at Great Yarmouth contain many accounts of such happenings at this time.

Soon after this misfortune another signal honor came to John Felton. At the meeting of the Assembly held 26 September, 1592 this minute was adopted—"Mr. Bailiff is by the whole House elected to be one of the Burgesses at the next Parliament for this Borough Town and Mr. John Felton is to be the other Burgess with Mr. Bailiff Dammett." The names of some of his fellow members in this Parliament are of interest because they show that he was associated at Westminster with many of the leading statesmen of his time. Among these men was Oliver St. John who for his services in the Low Countries and in Ireland was to be created Viscount Grandison and Baron Tregos. Another member was Henry Neville a few years later to be made Elizabeth's Ambassador to France. Robert Cecil the second son of Lord Burghley was then just beginning the distinguished career which lead in the next reign to his elevation to the Earldom of Salisbury. A cousin of Robert Cecil, Francis Bacon, renowned as one of the world's most famous philosophers and scholars was also a member. Sir Francis Drake represented Plymouth Borough, and Sir Walter Raleigh was serving for the third time as a member of Parliament. Our ancestor, therefore, found himself one of a very distinguished company when he took his seat in the House of Commons as member for Great Yarmouth.

26 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

Soon after this the ever recurring controversy with Lowestoft about Kirkley Roads again comes into the picture and John Felton rides to London and with two associates appears before the Privy Council to protect the Town’s interests. The proceedings on this occasion were long drawn out for he seems to have been in London from June until the following October when the hearings were apparently ended to the satisfaction of Great Yarmouth. Another reference to our ancestor at about this time in the minutes of the Assembly brings before us one of those historical exploits of the English sailors against the Spaniards. The minute of 16 February, 1595-6 reads “also Mr. Felton is appointed to ride up to London and to entreat Sir Robert Southwell,” at the time a Rear Admiral under his father-in-law, Charles Howard, Lord High Admiral of England “to be a means unto the Lord High Admiral for the allowing of this House to make choice of a captain of our ship of war and his authority to press men to serve therein.” This expedition was the famous one which entering the Harbor of Cadiz destroyed the Spanish Fleet at anchor in the Harbor and landing a force commanded by the Earl of Essex, Queen Elizabeth’s favorite, sacked and burned the city then the largest and richest of the Spanish seaports.

To the Parliament summoned to meet at Westminster 24 October, 1597, John Felton was again sent as one of the representatives of Great Yarmouth. In the official return for this session he is designated as “Senior” indicating that his son, John, had already reached a position of prominence at home. This Parliament was made up largely of the same men as the previous session. Robert Cecil had now become a Right Honorable and her Majesty’s principal Secretary of State, and Sir Walter Raleigh was again a member. At this session the question of the jurisdiction of Great Yarmouth over Kirkley Roads, a subject of controversy with Lowestoft for more than a hundred years in the Privy Council, was brought before the House and we may be sure that our ancestor was not backward in defending the claims of his native town. The Records of the session show that the contention of Great Yarmouth was upheld by the House, a victory of which the Yarmouth Assembly took notice in its 

# The Feltons in England and America

minute of 23 September, 1598. “It is agreed,” the Records reads, “by the whole House that Mr. Felton towards his usefulness and painstaking for the town, shall have both his own Hosts for one whole year from Michaelmas next and that he shall have ten lasts of herrings at his pleasure when and where he will at the host’s price.”

In 1599 John Felton was again appointed to ride to London “to make suit for the relase and setting at liberty of the ships and vessels that are restrained and stayed there, also to deal in other the Town’s business there.” The journey to London preceded by a short time his third election as Bailiff and it was during this third term that Great Yarmouth was visited by a celebrated Puritan divine, William Younger by name, who preached a sermon in the Parish Church, the purpose of which was, to quote from its introduction, to “minister instruction unto the people upon occasion of those present troubles which then were feared by the Spaniards.” This sermon was printed at London in 1600, and is dedicated “to the Worshipful Master, John Felton the Elder and Master Thomas Mansfield, Bailiffs of the Town of Great Yarmouth.” The presence of this Puritan preacher brings out plainly the religious temper of Great Yarmouth and this is emphasized by the next effort of John Felton in the Town’s behalf. It seems that the citizens were extremely anxious to establish a daily service of morning prayer in the Town. To this the Bishop of Norwich within whose Diocese the Parish of Great Yarmouth was situated, was decidedly opposed because he feared the services would be used to spread the Puritan doctrines already too pronounced at Great Yarmouth. At this juncture it was agreed in the Assembly “that Mr. Bailiff Felton shall ride over to My Lord Bishop and entreat his Lordship’s favor that there may be Morning Prayer every day in the week in two places of the Town, videlicet, the one in the Parish Church and the other in such place as the Town shall think meet and convenient.” The Bishop was unsympathetic and a month later Mr. Bailiff Felton was appointed to ride again to Norwich to take up anew the subject of Morning Prayers. This second visit was more successful for the Ambassador, taking advantage of the fact that the townspeople were paying the stipend of the minister of St.

28 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

Nicholas Church told the Bishop that this payment would end unless the Town’s wishes were complied with. The Bishop was won over by this practical argument and gave his sanction for the holding of Morning Prayers. The historian Manship, calls this the greatest of the many services which “that worthy grave Senator, John Felton” rendered his native town.

Once again the dispute with Lowestoft concerning Kirkley Roads appears upon the Assembly Books. The minute for 13 June, 1601, reads “Mr. Felton and Mr. William Gray are appointed to ride to London touching the removal and handling of the indemnities that are exhibited against the men of Yarmouth going to Kirkley Road for the demanding of the Town’s duties.” This was the last of our ancestor’s many rides to London and the last time his name appears on the Assembly Books of Great Yarmouth. Thirty seven years before his first important service to the Town had been concerned with this same question of collecting dues from vessels anchored in Kirkley Roads, and now at the end of his long career he rides to London to take up again the never ending controversy with Lowestoft.

The Registers of St. Nicholas Church make no mention of the burial of Margaret Manning who had become John Felton’s wife in 1559. The record of a second marriage was found in the nearby Parish of Earsham in Norfolk. The Parish Record there reads “1601, John Felton Gentleman of Yarmouth was married to Margery Fulkerd the 15 October.” Margery was a member of a very ancient family whose history runs back at least to the Conquest when her ancestors were living in Suffolk. On 11 March following this second marriage the Parish Register records the burial of Mr. John Felton in the chancel of the Church of St. Nicholas at whose ancient Font he had been baptized, where his marriage to Margaret Manning the mother of his children had been solemnized and to which these children had been brought for baptism. His public services began in the year in which Elizabeth ascended the throne and were now ended when her long and splendid reign was fast approaching its end. Henry Manship, the historian of Great Yarmouth, who was his contemporary, associate and friend, in writing of the Staple

### THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

House for Wool, part of which was being employed as the House of Morning Prayer, has this to say in regard to our ancestor—“Part thereof to a House of Morning Prayer and for the exercise of the Dutch Congregation, which was by that township, Anno 1600, by the special procurement of that worthy grave senator, Mr. John Felton (for virtuous men and such as have so well deserved of their country, are not to be passed over in silence, but vivo signari lapillo, to be marked on an everlasting stone), who for his well doing both in church and commonwealth, deserveth everlasting kind remembrances. His principal care and delight being all his lifetime altogether to advance God’s glory, and to do good to the Commonwealth of this Kingdom in general, but especially to this incorporation of Yarmouth, wherein he received his first breath and being; which far above his private estate he preferred. Three times he supplied the office of Bailiwick, in every which time he most worshipfully and worthily discharged the same. For the good of which township he, being often employed, spent not only a great part of his life but also of his worldly substance, and by his great labor and worthy endeavors, obtained many special benefits to the good of the township, as by the book of their Common Councils appeareth, which, here, for brevity I do pass over; only this one thing amongst many others his well doing, I will set down unto you; how that in that year being the 3rd time of his Bailiwick, there was, as formerly I touched, the said House of Morning Prayer builded.” In our day the investigator who searched the records at Great Yarmouth for the writer, after finishing his work in the latter part of 1890, wrote thus in regard to this fine old Elizabethan, “John Felton was by a long way and during many years the chief man in the place. His activity in the fearful period of the Armada and the entire confidence in him come out very strongly. In one of the most stirring periods of our history he was brought into contact not once or twice but habitually and constantly with the leading authorities of the Kingdom.” 

In order that one who had served so well in Church and Commonwealth might not be forgotten but as Manship says might be marked on an everlasting stone, a tablet was
```

placed in the South Transept of St. Nicholas Church in 1925 by some of John Felton’s American descendants, on which is the following inscription—“To the Glory of God and in Memory of John Felton a citizen of Great Yarmouth and a benefactor of this Church and Parish. He represented this ancient Borough in two of Queen Elizabeth’s Parliaments and three times filled the office of Bailliff. In the days of the threatened invasion by the Spanish Armada he was appointed to ride to London and there concerted measures with the Privy Council for the Town’s defense. A good part of his life and much of his worldly substance were devoted to the good of this his native place. He was buried in the Chancel, 11 March, 1601. This tablet is placed here by the descendants in the United States of America of his great-grandson, Nathaniel Felton who emigrated in 1633 from Yarmouth to Salem in the Colony of Massachusets Bay, 1925.”

The Parish Registers of St. Nicholas Church record the baptisms of twelve children of John Felton and his wife Margaret Manning. The eldest was a son, John, baptized 4 August, 1560 and the last a daughter, Judith, who was baptized 7 October, 1582. Of these children only four lived to maturity, three sons, John, Nicholas and Daniel who were living when their father’s will was made and a daughter, Dionis, who although twice married had died some years before her father. John Felton’s will was dated 8 March, 1601-2 only three days before his burial, but it is not a hastily prepared document for it goes into great detail as to his several bequests and genealogically is most valuable because it describes relationships very carefully and fully. His first care was for the Church of St. Nicholas toward the “reparation” of which he makes a bequest. Next he remembers the Lazar House and the poor of the Town. The preacher of the Church of St. Nicholas, Master Robert Jacler, and its minister, Master John Hill, are also remembered, but the House of Morning Prayer with the establishment of which he had been so intimately concerned during his last days is evidently very close to his Puritan heart. “I bequeath,” he says, “unto the continuation of the Prayer and Lecture lately begun in the new Chapel in Yarmouth ten

shillings a year to be levied out of my capital house wherein I do now dwell so long as the same exercises shall be continued forever.” Among his relatives his first care is for his well beloved wife, Marjery, who receives a bequest in money and all the goods which she brought with her at her marriage. Then comes his eldest son, John, who is to receive “all my houses, buildings, yards, grounds and appurtenances whatsoever, situated, lying and being in Yarmouth.” This bequest is conditioned on John’s making certain payments in money to other near relatives. Nicholas and Robert, his grandchildren, and sons of his son, Nicholas, are each to receive twenty five pounds. His daughter-in-law, Catharine, wife of his son, Daniel, is given twenty pounds, and a grandchild, the child of Daniel and Catharine is to have thirty pounds. The name of this grandchild is left blank in the will. He or she was evidently a new comer and the grandfather was not aware of the child’s name. One of the children of his deceased daughter, Dionis, is mentioned in these words—“I bequeath unto my grandchild, John Gross, son of my late daughter, Dionis, towards his maintenance at Cambridge ten pounds to be paid by forty shillings a year.” Evidently this grandson was ambitious to follow in the footsteps of his Uncle Nicholas, the future master of Pembroke and Bishop of Ely. The other children of Dionis were three daughters, Dionis, Martha and Judith, and each is to receive twenty pounds. His brother-in-law, John Skorch, received a small legacy and “unto my sister, his wife,” five pounds are bequeathed. Robert Robbins “my son-in-law” the second husband of his daughter, Dionis, is also remembered. The will closes with an affectionate and touching word to his son, Nicholas, who is appointed overseer of the will to whom he says “I do bequeath a little silver cup of mine.” Of the witnesses to the will, William Young had been Junior Bailiff in 1595, William Fleming was the late chosen minister of the House of Morning Prayer, Robert Jacler was “our minister,” Robert Robbins was the second husband of his daughter, Dionis, and Henry Manship was the historian of Great Yarmouth.

The third and next generation of our family in Great Yarmouth consisted of the four children already named of

32 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

the elder John and his wife, Margaret Manning. The direct line of the emigrants to Salem descends through John the eldest of these four children. He was baptized at St. Nicholas Church 4 August, 1560 and here he was married 19 September, 1583 to Judith Damrell. Judith’s family name also occurs as Dameron. Her father was Thomas Dameron, als. Damrell, and her mother was Elizabeth Gray. The home of the Damrells was at Lowestoft, not far from Great Yarmouth and the family was an ancient one in East Anglia. In the Probate Registry at Ipswich two Dameron wills were found which show that the family was living in Suffolk as early as the middle of the 15th century. The wills of both Judith’s parents were found recorded at Norwich. That of her father was dated November 1574 and was proved in the following January. Judith’s mother whose name appears both as Isabel and as Elizabeth its English equivalent outlived her first husband by many years and married a second time. Her will was made in 1602 when she described herself as Elizabeth Cox, widow of Great Yarmouth, and in she refers several times to John Felton, “my son-in-law.” The Damerons were possessed of a very considerable property and Judith on her marriage and at her mother’s death brought to her husband a very handsome estate.

The first child of John Felton the Younger and his wife, Judith Damrell was a son, John, baptized in the Church of St. Nicholas 3 January, 1584-5 and it is through this third John whom we shall hear of later as John the Brewer that the direct line of the emigrants to Salem descends. There were certainly four perhaps six children in the family of John and Judith. The other children were a daughter, Margaret, who certainly did not long survive for a second daughter, Margaret, was baptized 20 March, 1587-8. No further baptisms of their children are recorded until 1601 when on 2 December in that year “Francis Felton, son of John the Younger and Judith,” was baptized. Francis lived only until the following January when his burial is recorded 17 of that month. The next baptism of a child of this family brings before us one of the emigrants to Salem when on 19 December 1604, Benjamin Felton son of John and Judith was baptized. He it was who accompanied his

# The Feltons in England and America

brother John's widow, Ellen and her children to Salem. There was possibly one other child in the family of John and Judith, a daughter, Judith, whose baptism is recorded 11 February, 1606-7. Her parents are, however, given on the Parish Register as John and Margaret. The Parish Records of Great Yarmouth were very carefully kept but it looks as though the Parish Clerk had here made a slip for there was no John and Margaret Felton living in Great Yarmouth at this time, at least as far as appears from any record found. That there was a daughter in this family who grew up and was married is indicated in Bishop Nicholas Felton’s will as will be seen later.

The life of John the Younger can be sketched in considerable detail from the Records at Great Yarmouth. His career was in no sense as notable as that of his father and especially after the latter’s death was in many respects a sad one because of pecuniary difficulties. He is first mentioned on the Assembly Books in 1586 when he was given permission to build over the lane or “row” on which his house was located, and in the following April he was serving as second in command of his father’s armed ship as has already been described. He evidently continued his nautical activities for in October 1590 the Court Rolls record that John Felton the Younger was presented for “annoying the quay with four pieces of ordnance” and at the same Court, he was again charged with “annoying the Crane quay with a great mast.” We can only guess as to the work he was engaged in but the time was one of great activity against the Spaniards. The year before Drake had made his famed descent upon Corunna and in this very year, 1590, the elder John Felton had been in London seeking help from the Lord Treasurer and the Privy Council for the protection of the sailors and fisherman then detained in the harbor of Great Yarmouth by the activities of England’s enemies on the high seas. Two years later the Younger John was compelled to ask help from the Assembly. At a meeting of that body held 26 September, 1592 it was recorded that “John Felton the Younger made a request to the House for having of four of his hosts freely to himself for a benevolence and help toward his great loss. Upon whose petition the House hath

34 The Feltons in England and America

granted him that he shall have his four hosts to his own use wholly for three whole years for himself as a small recompense towards his loss.” No details are given as to the nature of his misfortune, but the great risks which the merchants of Great Yarmouth were continually exposed to in carrying on the fisheries and their other maritime enterprises must always be kept in mind.

In 1593, John the Younger was chosen Constable of the South Leet or Ward where the family home was, and in the next year he was one of the Jury appointed to choose the Borough Officers for the ensuing year, a duty which his father had performed many times. In September, 1594, an important piece of business was assigned him when “John Felton, Jr. is appointed to go to Lynn upon Saturday next and buy to and for the use of the Town a hundred quarters of rye and more if he can.” On this occasion the canny Assembly promised to pay all his expenses if he succeeded in his mission, but if not they were to bear only one half his charges. At this time the younger John was evidently one of four members of the Corporation who because of the office they were holding were by custom required to provide a banquet for their fellow members of the Assembly. The expense involved in “purveying” some of these feasts was considerable and in this case the four men concerned were allowed to make a payment into the Borough Treasury in lieu of providing the banquet. The office the younger John was holding is not named, but he was probably one of the four auditors a position to which he was elected in three subsequent years. In 1596 and 1598, he was again one of the Jury to select town officers for the next year. The Lay Subsidy Rolls at this period show that he was paying taxes on goods valued at three pounds and upwards. At the same time his father’s assessment was for goods of something more than five pounds so that the younger man was catching up with his father as far as worldly possessions were concerned.

At a meeting of the Assembly held 9 March, 1597-8, the two Johns, father and son appear again. The record reads “At this Assembly upon the request of Mr. John Felton the Elder in behalf of his son, John Felton, the House hath granted and given his son leave to set a porch and gate

## The Feltons in England and America

before his house on the Dene side which he late purchased of old Mr. Gross." The Dene was the sandy space between the town walls and the sea and "old Mr. Gross" was the person already frequently referred to in what has been said about the elder John. In his will, Mr. Gross who it will be recalled had married a sister of John the Younger’s mother, Margaret Manning, refers to this transaction when he speaks of a certain house and land bequeathed to his nephew, Edmund Gross, as abutting upon the house and ground "which I sold to John Felton the Younger." No further reference to the younger John was found on the Assembly Books until after the death of his father in March, 1602. At the annual election on St. John’s Day in that year he was chosen one of the two Muragers whose duties are thus described by the historian Manship, "Yet be there yearly two discreet and expert men chosen principally to oversee them (the town walls) which be called Muragers who do gather the murage money and look to the securing and cleaning of the armor, amending and new making of carriages, providing of shot and powder, repairing of walls, gates and ramparts of the Town and of all other things meet and convenient belonging there to."

In this same year Elizabeth Cox the widowed mother of the younger John’s wife, Judith Damrell, died and left to them five properties in Great Yarmouth besides the Damrell home in Lowestoft. John had recently acquired by his father’s will the latter’s home in Great Yarmouth. He and his wife were now apparently well provided for. But in the next year, 1603, they sold one of the properties Judith had just received from her mother to Robert Robbins, the second husband of John’s sister, Dionis. The sale of this property marks the beginning of the business troubles which overtook the Younger John and continued until 1612. The Borough Court Rolls tell of many actions brought by and against him during these years and show that he was deeply involved financially. But the confidence of his fellow members of the Corporation was not affected by these reverses for in October, 1605, John was chosen one of the Twenty Fours, the senior body in the Corporation later known as the Aldermen.

1159046

36 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

was found among the Close Rolls in the shape of an indenture made in August, 1607, between John Felton of Great Yarmouth, Merchant and Daniel Felton, Citizen and Grocer of London by which John sold to Daniel a piece of property John “late had of the gift and confirmation of John Skorch late of Great Yarmouth Cordwainer, deceased, and Margaret, his wife.” Daniel was John’s younger brother who was seen later had already become a Freeman of the Grocers Company of London, and John Skorch was the husband of John’s father’s sister. What brought about these troubles cannot be now determined but it must always be kept in mind that the younger John like his father was engaged in a very precarious business in which a single serious disaster at sea might easily have wiped out his entire fortune. That there was nothing questionable connected with John’s difficulties is shown by numerous entries on the Assembly Books which tell of the sympathy of his fellow members of the Corporation. In May, 1611, the then Haven Master was removed from office, and “John Felton to relieve his decayed and distressed estate shall be Haven Master and to begin his office at mid-summer next.” In repeated instances the taxes assessed against him were cancelled and financial assistance was given him in connection with his hosts and in other ways. Finally he was obliged to sell the old family home which had come to him from his father. This was bought by Robert Robbins who seems to have come to the younger John’s rescue repeatedly in these times of stress.

No record was found of the younger John’s death and no will of his was discovered. He was probably alive in July, 1625, when his brother, Nicholas, the Bishop of Ely, in his will makes several references to his eldest brother, John, at Yarmouth. He also probably outlived his son, John the Brewer, for in recording the latter’s burial in March, 1627, the Parish Register identifies this third John as “John Felton, Brewer,” and it was very unusual at Great Yarmouth to thus designate a man by his calling or profession. It is to be inferred from this that there was another John living in Great Yarmouth at the time who could have been none other than his father, the second John in our line of descent. When Daniel Felton of London sold some land in November, 1628,

# THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

he referred to his brother as John Felton "late of Great Yarmouth." John's death, therefore, occurred in all probability between March, 1627, and November 1628.

Before going further with the direct line of the emigrants to Salem it will be interesting to say something of the other children of the elder John. The second child in his family was a daughter, Dionis, who as already stated was baptized 11 January, 1561-2. She is mentioned frequently in the family archives beginning with the will of her grandmother, Margaret Felton. She was evidently named for Dionis her mother’s sister, the wife of the elder John Gross. When a girl of seventeen she married the younger John Gross 14 December, 1579. The Grosses were a very ancient family in Norfolk going back as far as the reign of King Stephen and the intimate relations between them and the Feltons come out again and again in the records at Great Yarmouth. To Dionis and John Gross there were born four children who are mentioned in their grandfather Felton’s will of 1601. Three of these children were daughters by name Dionis, Martha and Judith. The fourth was a son, John, who in his grandfather Felton’s will is bequeathed ten pounds to be used for his education at Cambridge. Dionis’ first husband died between October, 1592 and May, 1595, the dates respectively of the making and proving of his will in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury. He describes himself as John Gross the Younger of Great Yarmouth, Merchant, and to the will John Felton, Jr. is one of the witnesses. On 29 October, 1595 the Parish Register records the marriage of Robert Robbins and Dionis Gross, widow. As already noted this second husband was very helpful in a financial way to his wife’s brother, our ancestor, the younger John Felton. Dionis Robbins was buried 15 April, 1599. The names of her daughters appear on the Parish Registers when their marriages occurred and they are also mentioned several times in the will of their uncle, Nicholas Felton, the Bishop of Ely. They are, however, not of importance in tracing the direct line of our Salem Feltons.

Next we come to the third child of the elder John and his wife, Margaret Manning. He was named Nicholas, no doubt in honor of the patron saint of Great Yarmouth in

38 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

whose Parish Church he was baptized 3 August, 1563. His early education was obtained at the Free Grammar School of his native town and it is to this school without doubt that our ancestor the emigrant Nathaniel owes that superior education so apparent on the records at Salem, where his clear and legible handwriting and his scholarly training is everywhere in evidence. Nicholas Felton completed his education at the University of Cambridge where he matriculated as a pensioner at Queens’ College 26 June, 1577. He received the degree of Bachelor of Arts from Pembroke Hall in 1580, and from this time on it was with this College that he associated himself. Of it he became a Fellow in 1583 and from it in the next year he received the degree of Master of Arts. His ability as a classical scholar was soon recognized and three years later when only twenty three he was appointed Greek Lecturer at Pembroke. He was now well established in his chosen calling in the Church and received from his College as the years went by the degrees which are equivalent to our Bachelor of Divinity in 1591 and Doctor of Divinity in 1602 the year in which his father died at the family home in Great Yarmouth.

Bentham in his History of Ely Cathedral states that Nicholas Felton was married in 1588. His wife was Elizabeth, widow of Dr. Robert Norgate, Master of Corpus Christi College at Cambridge and Vice Chancellor of the University. Elizabeth was a daughter of John Baker, M.A., a half brother of Mathew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. At the time of her second marriage Elizabeth Norgate had three children, all sons, and these children were brought up by Nicholas Felton as his own. He provided liberally for them in his will and looked carefully after their education and future careers. The second of these Norgate children, Edward by name, is of special importance in the story of our Felton ancestors. Thomas Fuller, the author of the “History of the Worthies of England” and one of the accepted authorities of his time as a biographer and historian was a close friend of this Edward Norgate and was with him when he died at the Herald’s College in 1650. In his account of Edward Norgate, Fuller tells us that Dr. Norgate at his

# The Feltons in England and America

death “left behind him a widow who married Nicholas Felton, afterwards Master of Pembroke Hall and Bishop of Ely and a son named Edward who taking a fancy to heraldry and limming was trained in that way by his father-in-law. He became the best limner of our age and left few heirs to the kind, none to the degree of his art therein.” Edward Norgate repaid his stepfather for the pains taken with his education and became one of the best known heralds and illuminators of his time and in 1634 was appointed Windsor Herald, one of the highest offices in the Herald’s College. It was he who painted the portrait of Nicholas Felton now hanging in the Bishop’s Palace at Ely, and we may be sure that so high an official of the Herald’s office would not have placed upon this portrait a coat of arms to which his stepfather and benefactor was not clearly entitled.

To Nicholas Felton and his wife, Elizabeth, there were born three and perhaps four children, all sons. Only two of these were alive at the time of the Bishop’s death in 1626, Nicholas, whom his father calls eldest son in his will, and Robert. Another son, John, died in infancy as is disclosed on the Parish Register of St. Antholins’ Church in Budge Row, London, on which is recorded the baptism 1 March, 1591-2 of John Felton, the son of “Mr. Felton, Parson” and 11 days later the infant John’s burial. There may have been another son, Stewart, for in Nicholas Felton’s will is this item, “to my son Stewart’s widow and daughter of my brother John Felton, forty pounds. To her daughter Elizabeth that is married twenty pounds.” No other trace of this Stewart was found and it is possible that Nicholas Felton may have written “my son’s steward’s widow.” However, the matter is of no great importance to us.

Quite a little of interest was found concerning the two sons, Nicholas and Robert, who survived their father, the Bishop. Both were graduated at the University of Cambridge and entered the Church. Nicholas became Rector of Stretham a small town on the main road between Cambridge and Ely. Here he lived until ejected from his benefice under the Commonwealth in 1644. This younger Nicholas was three times married but died childless. His first wife, Elizabeth, was buried at Stretham, 23 December, 1624. In the following

40 The Feltons in England and America

April he married at Downham, one of the favorite residences of his father, Mistress Susannah Clench. At the time of his death, his wife's name was Jael. She was a daughter of Roger Landford, paymaster of the English Fleet under Hawkins in the year of the Armada. Robert the other surviving son of the Bishop also entered the Church. His wife’s name was Susan but her family was not discovered. He became Rector of Little Gransden in Cambridgeshire to which he was instituted in November, 1623. He died about 1645 and left a large family, six of whom lived to maturity and of these three were sons, Nicholas, Robert and John. All were of scholarly tastes for the better part of their lives were spent at the University. The line of the Bishop was not traced beyond these grandsons but they may well have descendants of the Felton name living in England today.

And now a few words about the career of our distinguished relative Nicholas Felton, the Bishop of Ely. In January, 1596, he had been collated by John Whitgift, Archbishop of Canterbury to the Rectory of the famous Church of St. Mary LeBow in Cheapside, London, and there he continued as Rector until consecrated Bishop of Bristol in 1616. Other preferments in the Church came to him as he grew in years and reputation. At various times he was Rector of Blagdon in Somerset and of Easton Magna in Essex, as well as a Prebendary of St. Paul’s Cathedral in London, and Chaplain to King James I. But it was with St. Antholin’s in Budge Row, London, that he was most closely and continuously associated. Even after his election to the Bishoprics of Bristol and of Ely, this London Parish remained closest to his heart. Here his wife and infant son, John, were buried, and here he too was to be laid to rest after a rectorate of twenty eight years. The Church itself was destroyed in the great fire of London in 1666, and although rebuilt was taken down in 1875, the shifting of population having rendered a church in that location no longer necessary.

In the June before his wife’s death, which occurred in January, 1606, he was evidently seriously ill and was recuperating in the sea breezes of Yarmouth his boyhood home. A letter was found among the Edgerton Manuscripts in the British Museum written by his good friend, Francis Morris,

# THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

in which this illness is referred to and in which Morris asks Sir Basingbourne Gawdy, a prominent man in the eastern counties to obtain a buck from one of the Earl of Arundel's Parks nearest to Yarmouth, "for" to quote from the letter "a principal friend of mine, one Mr. Dr. Felton born there but living in London where his charge is, a very rare man both for his virtues and for his excellent learning and painful preaching and studies wherein he hath already almost consumed himself, the more pity and grief to all that know his worth." This letter was dated "From my poor house in the old Palace in Westminster this 26th of June, 1605." At this very time Nicholas Felton was busily engaged as one of the translators of the Bible now universally known as King James Version. Fifty-four of the most distinguished scholars of the Realm were chosen for this great work and divided into six groups. Our relative's group met at Westminster and to it the translation of the Epistle of St. Paul and the Canonical Epistles was assigned. This letter of Francis Morris raises the query as to whether the studies with which Nicholas Felton has almost consumed himself were not connected with the translation of the Bible.

A few years later, his friendship with Launcelot Andrews, one of the most distinguished scholars and divines who ever adorned the English Church comes out clearly. Their friendship must have begun in early manhood for both were students at Pembroke at about the same time and both were Fellows of that College. The Mastership of Pembroke had become vacant and Andrews on 27 July, 1612, addressed a letter to Sir Thomas Lake then Secretary of State, recommending his friend for appointment to the vacancy. He writes, "I know you wish well to Dr. Felton and his Majesty hath formerly been pleased to signify his good liking of him and to wish him some preferment and even this place itself." Launcelot Andrews' endeavor to have his friend chosen Master of Pembroke did not bear fruit at this time. But Nicholas Felton was 4 March, 1616-17, "to the great joy of all well wishers of the College 'made head of this ancient institution, a position which he was to hold until his translation from the Bishopric of Bristol to that of Ely. At the

42 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

end of this year an even greater honor was to come to him, namely his election as Bishop of Bristol. There is among the archives at Lambeth Palace in London a long account in Latin of his consecration as Bishop of Bristol and in one of the gossiping letters of Chamberlain a famous letter writer of that day to Sir Dudley Carleton this ceremony is referred to in the following words—“On Sunday last, Dr. Felton, Bishop of Bristol and Dr. Mountain, Bishop of Lincoln, were consecrated at Lambeth where beside the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishops of Ely, London, Litchfield and Rochester, the Archbishop of Spalato concurred in the ceremony of imposing hands.” Nicholas Felton in right of his consecration as Bishop was now one of the nobility of England, and in order of precedence came after the Viscounts and before the Barons and was entitled to a seat in the House of Lords. Almost immediately after becoming Bishop of Bristol, he seems to have been nominated to the Bishopric of Coventry and Litchfield a much more desirable See than that of Bristol, but Launcelot Andrews then Bishop of Ely, having been translated to Winchester, Nicholas Felton followed in his friend’s footsteps and was himself translated to Ely where he remained until his death. He now came into possession of all the privileges and revenues of the See of Ely one of the richest and most famous in all England. The splendid opulence of Ely is frequently referred to by contemporary writers and among its temporalities were several fine residences. Of these the Manor House at Downham near Ely seems to have been the Bishop’s favorite place for retirement and rest and it was here that he was living when his oldest son, Nicholas, married his second wife, Mistress Susannah Clench, in 1625. But of all his residences Ely House in Holborn London was by far the most famous. It was one of the most beautiful and extensive private residences in the capital and is often referred to by contemporary writers as having been occupied temporarily by distinguished visitors to the English Court. All that now remains of this town residence of the Bishops of Ely is the beautiful little Gothic Church of St. Etheldreda in Ely Place, London, the former Chapel of Ely House, and

# THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

this should be visited by every member of our family who happens to be in the English Capital.  
A very full and detailed biography of Nicholas Felton could be assembled from the records preserved in the English Archives, but only a few of the important events with which he was connected can be mentioned here. Among the "Remembrancia" of the City of London is preserved a copy of a letter inviting him to preach one of the annual Easter sermons at the "Spital" or Hospital of St. Mary without Bishopsgate, an honor extended only to the most distinguished divines of the kingdom. The interesting and colorful ceremonies observed on these occasions is described by Stowe, a contemporary writer, in his "Survey of London." Another event by many regarded as the most important of his entire career was concerned with the bitter contest which arose between the Puritans and the Anti-Puritans over the appointment of a lectureship in Trinity Church, Cambridge. The appointment was in the gift of the Bishop of Ely and gave to the lecturer an admirable opportunity of impressing the students of the University with his religious views. The savage controversy brought about an exchange of letters between Nicholas Felton and the King which show our relative to have been a wise and skillful diplomat, and was finally settled by the appointment of John Preston, Master of Emanuel College and one of the most noted Puritan preachers of his day. There are numerous letters written by Nicholas Felton preserved among the many collections of such material in England. Two such letters were discovered not long ago among a lot of old papers in a stable on the estate of the present representative of Sir Thomas Coke a leading lawyer and statesman of the reign of Charles I. This letter was written in June, 1626, and only a few months later Nicholas Felton died at Chingford in Essex and was buried 6 October, 1626, in St. Antholin's Church, Budge Row, London.  
The esteem and genuine affection in which he was held by his contemporaries is everywhere evidenced in their writings and letters. Perhaps the finest tribute to him is that con

44 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

tained in Thomas Fuller's "Church History," the standard work in its field and always regarded as one of the English Classics. Of Nicholas Felton, Fuller writes "I humbly crave the reader's pardon for omitting due time of the death of Reverend Dr. Nicholas Felton, Bishop of Ely as buried before (though dying some days after) Bishop Andrews, and indeed great was the conformity betwixt them, both being sons of sea-faring men (who by God's blessing on their industry attained comfortable estates) both scholars, Fellows and Masters of Pembroke Hall, both great scholars, painful Preachers in London for many years with no less profit to others than credit to themselves, both successively Bishops of Ely. This Bishop Felton had a sound Head and a sanctified Heart, beloved of God and all good men, very hospitable to all and charitable to the poor. He died 5 of October, 1626, and lieth buried under the Communion Table of St. Antholins in London whereof he had been Minister for twenty eight years."

Nicholas Felton's will is a long and carefully drawn document. Like his father's it is especially important in a genealogical sense for the family relationships are set down clearly and in detail. It was dated 27 July, 1625, and proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury 7 October, 1626. Those to whom bequests are made are divided into three groups. The first is made up of his own children and his stepchildren the Norgates. The second includes his other blood relations and the third his servants and friends. "To my son, Nicholas," he writes, "my eldest son the Parson of Stretham, I do give two hundred pounds. To my son Robert, beside all the money which he doth or shall owe me at my death, of which I do discharge him, I do give the sum of four hundred pounds, of which I hope he will be saving the more for the education and preferring of his children." Besides this to each of Robert's children alive at their grandfather's death, fifty pounds are to be given at the age of twenty or on their marriage. Susan, the wife of his son Robert receives twenty pounds as does the then wife of his son Nicholas, who is not more particularly described. Next his stepsons, the Norgates, are all remembered. After these bequests the will continues "secondly next to my children I

# The Feltons in England and America

do give among my poor kindred at Yarmouth or elsewhere in manner and form as followeth—For my cousin, John Felton, my eldest brother’s son in Yarmouth, my will is that within six months after my decease my executors lend to him upon good security the sum of two hundred pounds for the space of three years without any consideration.” John is also given fifty pounds outright, and his mother “my brother John’s wife forty pounds.” This John who is so carefully distinguished is, of course, John Felton the Brewer of the fourth generation at Great Yarmouth and the father of the younger emigrants to Salem. Next the children of the Bishop’s sister, Dionis, are remembered. Among these is “my cousin Robert Gross, my cousin Dionis Gross her son,” to whom one hundred pounds are left in order that he may pursue his studies at the University of Cambridge. Then comes the sole reference to one of the emigrants to Salem. This is a bequest of forty pounds to “my cousin Benjamin Felton, my brother John’s son.” In this second group is the bequest “to my son Stewart’s widow and daughter to my brother, John Felton,” who has already been referred to. The placing of this bequest in the second group rather than in the first which included the Bishop’s immediate family suggests that the reading should be “my son’s steward’s widow” rather than that given by the copyist of the will. In the third group are included the Bishop’s servants, who are described very much in detail and also his friends and associates. In this group is a bequest to his brother Daniel who is given twenty pounds to buy a basin or ewer, and one hundred pounds besides. Immediately following this is a bequest “to my cousin Philip.” Daniel is, of course, the brother living in London and the Liveryman of the Grocer’s Company and it may be surmised that “my cousin Philip” was Daniel’s son. The Bishop closes his will with these words addressed to his sons who are appointed executors “praying them by all means to see this last will and testament truly performed and (if it may be) with that unity, peace and love which becometh brethren in the performance of a father’s will.” A solemn and fatherly admonition, which, sad to say, the sons failed to heed, for in less than two years after the Bishop’s death his sons were engaged in litigation.

46 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

with one another in Chancery, the details of which are not important to us. There are two portraits of Nicholas Felton preserved, one at Pembroke College in Cambridge, which is said to have been painted at the time he was Bishop of Bristol and the second now hanging in the Bishop’s Palace at Ely. The history of this second portrait is traced in some notes and a letter of the Rev. William Cole, a celebrated Cambridge antiquary of the 17th century, now preserved among the Additional Manuscripts in the British Museum. Cole makes this note in regard to the portrait, “I purchased one of the best pictures I ever saw of that time of Bishop Nicholas Felton of Ely with arms, gules, two lions passant ermine crowned Or having a mullet for a difference in the dexter chief impaled by the arms of the See of Ely and ensigned with a mitre, at Mr. Sclator Bacon’s sale at Catley in Cambridgeshire, which I gave to the Right Reverend Sir Thomas Gooch, Lord Bishop of Ely and a Baronet to be put up in the Palace there which when that Bishop died, the present Sir Thomas Gooch was desirous to take away and carried it to Benacre, but the present worthy Bishop of Chester, my good friend, being by when I gave it to Bishop Gooch, and he telling the present Lord Bishop of Ely, Dr. Mawson of my design in giving it, his Lordship sent to me to desire I would explain it, which I accordingly did and the picture is now replaced in the gallery at Ely Palace 1757.” Five years later Cole writes thus to Horace Walpole author of “Anecdotes of Painting in England.” “It is very probable that an half length portrait of Bishop Felton with his arms impaled by those of the See of Ely and ensigned with a mitre and which I made a present of to the late Sir Thomas Gooch, Baronet, Lord Bishop of Ely, for the use of him and his successors to be hung up in the gallery of the Palace at Ely is by this Edward Norgate. The head is excellently well finished and full of life, but the lawn sleeves and drapery stiff. It formerly belonged to Sclator Bacon, Esq., member for the Town of Cambridge, and I bought it with some other pictures out of his collection at the sale of his goods at Catley in Cambridgeshire. There is a picture of Bishop Felton in the library of Pembroke Hall not comparable to this.”

NICHOLAS FELTON, BISHOP OF ELY, 1619-1626, from a Portrait now in the Bishop's Palace at Ely, England



# THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

The importance to us of this note and letter can hardly be overestimated. Cole was one of the most reliable antiquaries and collectors of his time and his statement that the portrait with its coat of arms is the work of Edward Norgate must be accepted without qualification. It is unbelievable also that a responsible Herald and a man under such weighty obligations as Norgate was to the Bishop would have placed a coat of arms on the portrait to which his subject did not have the clearest right and title. Cole’s statement that Nicholas Felton’s arms were differenced by a mullet or five pointed star is also of great importance. Its use shows that Norgate traced his stepfather’s ancestry back to a third son in some earlier generation of the Felton family. The same arms appear on the impressions of his seal attached to the Bishop’s letters and official papers, but no mullet is apparent on these impressions. So diminutive an object would hardly be placed on a small seal, and even if there might not appear on the impression.

Going back now to the children of John Felton, the Elder at Great Yarmouth, we come to the youngest child who lived to maturity in his family. This was Daniel who was baptized at St. Nicholas Church 18 February, 1571-2. He left his native town when about fifteen years old and was apprenticed to a Liveryman of the Grocer’s Company in London, one of the twelve great Livery Companies of that city. The records of the Company show that 21 November, 1586, Daniel was apprenticed to Richard Brattle for a period of eight years from the preceding Michaelmas and the record books of the Company outline his subsequent career. His apprenticeship ended 6 November, 1594, when he was sworn and became a Freeman of the Company. Nineteen years later 26 March, 1613, he was chosen one of the Governing Board. The record reads “And thereupon after deliberate consideration and the names of the generality collected and presented, the whole Court proceeded to the nomination and election of such persons of the said generality as were thought satisfactory to be admitted into the said Clothing and Livery of this Company, by collecting and pricking a certain number out of the same according to the accustomed manner, and by pricking these persons whose names ensue being to the

48 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

number of twenty four persons were elected and proven to be of the said Livery.” Among those chosen was Daniel Felton who was now entitled to wear the full livery of the Company. Advancement came slowly and seven years later 17 August, 1624, he was admitted “to be of the Assistants of this right worthy Company and was sworn and placed in Court, next after Mr. Francis Slater.” Thereafter he is always given the title of “Mister” just as his father was after he had been elected Bailiff of Great Yarmouth. Soon after this Daniel was appointed one of the renters of the Company, his duty being to receive the rents from the Company’s extensive properties in London and elsewhere, and to pay these over to those in authority as directed by the Court. In accordance with the rules and customs of the Company it followed from this last appointment that as those senior to him in office were automatically retired he would in due course become Master of the Company, a highly honorable position both in that day and in this. When the day came for him to be advanced to the next higher position as second Warden, he asked to be relieved of that office for the time being. No reason for his declining to accept one of the highest offices in his Company appears on the record. He may have suffered pecuniary losses or his health may have been failing for he died not long after. The precise time of his death was not discovered, but he was not alive in October, 1631, as is shown in the Chancery Proceeding of Damrell versus Holt of that date.

The Parish in which Daniel lived in London was found by examining the bonds given by his brother, Nicholas, upon the latter’s advancement to various preferments in the Church. The surety on one of these bonds is Daniel Felton of the Parish of St. Margaret’s, New Fish Street, a small Parish near London Bridge. It was hoped that this discovery might lead to some knowledge of his immediate family. Unfortunately, the Parish Registers of St. Margaret’s were destroyed with the Church in the great fire of 1666, and no transcripts were found among the records of the Bishop of London. So nothing came of this promising discovery. In the will of his father, the elder John of Great Yarmouth, Daniel’s wife, Catharine, is mentioned, and in Water’s

# The Feltons in England and America

"Genealogical Gleanings" it is shown that she was the daughter of John and Joan (Hawkins) Stafford. That Daniel and Catharine had a child in 1601 is evident from the grandfather's will, but the child's name is not given, and the Philip Felton mentioned in the Bishop of Ely's will may have been their son. No will of Daniel was found. Whether Daniel left any Felton descendants is uncertain, but the John Felton of the Island of Barbadoes mentioned in Hotten's "Lists" and already referred to may have been his son.

A search among the Records of the West Indian Island disclosed that the Feltons appeared there as early as 1646 when an Ann Felton was married to Jerome Deacon in Christ Church Parish and that the John Felton of Hotten's "Lists" was buried in the Cathedral at Bridgetown in 1694. The inscription on his tomb reads—"Here lieth the body of John Felton, Citizen and Goldsmith of London who departed this life the 14th May, 1694, aged 62 years and 9 months." John, therefore, was born about August, 1631, and could not have been John the youngest child of John the Brewer and Ellen Thrower who was baptized at Great Yarmouth 16 September, 1629, and who is not accounted for among the emigrants to Salem. This John of Barbadoes was married twice, first to Cordelia Hawkins in 1659, and next to Elizabeth Guise in 1691. The oldest of this John’s children was a son Daniel, a name which recalls Daniel, Citizen and Grocer of London. The facts that John of Barbadoes was a citizen of London and his first wife a Hawkins, a family to which Daniel of London was related through his wife’s mother, Joan Hawkins, both point to the probability of a connection between these Feltons of Barbadoes and the London family of Daniel. The Feltons disappeared entirely from the records of the West Indian island in 1709, and, although the search there was continued to 1750, no mention was found of any other Felton.

We now come back to the direct line of the emigrants to Salem in the person of John the Brewer, son of John the Younger, and grandson of John the Elder, Bailiff and Member of Parliament. John the Brewer was baptized at St. Nicholas Church 3 January, 1586, and the records of the same Church show that he was buried 17 March, 1626-7. His life, therefore, was not a long one. He had married 22 April, 1612,

50 The Feltons in England and America

Ellen Thrower, who was later to appear on the Records at Salem as the widow Felton. The baptisms of their seven children are recorded on the Parish Registers of St. Nicholas Church. Their eldest child was given the name John following the family custom of four generations in England. This first John did not long survive for his baptism and burial are recorded in June, 1613. The second child of John and Ellen was our ancestor Nathaniel who was baptized 10 May, 1615. The third child of John and Ellen was another John who was baptized 9 April, 1617, and it is probably his burial which is recorded 6 October, 1620. The next child in this family was a daughter, Ruth, who was baptized 31 October, 1619. Nothing further was found in regard to her. Two years later another daughter was baptized 28 November, 1621. She was given the name Judith, evidently for her grandmother, Judith Damrell. She is found later at Salem where she married John Ingersoll the brother of Deacon Richard Ingersoll at whose house in Salem Village the first hearings in the Witchcraft trials were held. A third daughter of John and Ellen was baptized 17 December, 1623. She was named Margaret and like her older sister, Judith, appears later at Salem where she became the wife of Christopher Waller and where after his death in 1676 she married Robert Fuller. The last and seventh child of John the Brewer and Ellen was a third John baptized 17 September, 1626, just six months to a day before his father was laid to rest in St. Nicholas Churchyard.

There is not much among the records at Great Yarmouth to throw light on the comparatively short life of John the Brewer. His calling was a very lucrative one in Great Yarmouth because of the many ships which visited that seaport, and there replenished their supplies. This was especially true during the Free Fair when the fishermen from all the eastern coasts of England as well as from Flanders and the Low Countries across the North Sea came to the thriving port to sell their fish. Early in 1620 an effort was made by the local brewers to incorporate themselves as a separate Guild independent of the town authorities. This lead to a bitter contest with the Corporation which took strong measures against the brewers before the authorities in London. By pure chance a document was discovered in looking through

THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA 51

the index to the Signet Bills for the 17th year of James I which proved to be a copy of the very Charter over which this contest was raging. It was of special interest because it indicated the standing of our ancestor among the brewers of Great Yarmouth. In the Guild which was to be established the governing body was to consist of a Master, two Wardens, and six Assistants. The Master was to be Thomas Harbottle and the two Wardens, John Robbins and John Felton. What the outcome was of this attempt of the Brewers is not known but there seems to have been no hostility on the part of the Corporation to John Felton because of it. After his death his widow, Ellen, carried on his business for sometime, probably up to the time of her emigration. The Assembly Books under date of 13 April, 1632, have this reference to her “Whereas John Felton Brewer in his lifetime hath long time and his wife after his decease hath hitherto continued to be tenant of the Mountyard, paying yearly for the rent thereof ten shillings to the Muragers and that the Muragers have notwithstanding had the necessary use thereof at all times upon all occasions which concerned their office, and have also to that end kept a key of the gate. Now for that the Muragers as it seemeth at the Gunners’ request hath given her warning to depart from the said yard, she petitioned this House to continue tenant thereof as before for the like rent and upon the like terms. Which this House considering of do hold indifferent. And, therefore, does condescend unto her request to enjoy the said Mountyard as before she hath done and as above specified during the good pleasure of this House.”

John the Brewer’s will was signed 2 March, 1626-7, and was proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury 11th of the following June. There are three witnesses to the will one of whom is John’s brother, Benjamin, who a few years later was one of the emigrants to Salem. As executors he appoints his wife, Ellen, and his brother-in-law, Augustine Thrower, and provides, as has already been stated that his goods should be disposed of and the balance of his estate should be used for the maintenance of his wife and the bringing up of his children. Ellen left a widow by her husband’s early death continued to carry on his business as has been

52 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

seen. She was the daughter of John and Margaret Thrower and her baptism is recorded on the Parish Registers 4 August, 1588. Her brother, Augustine, died long after the emigration to Salem. His will was dated 24 January, 1666-7 and proved in the Archdeaconry Court at Norwich 23 April following. Augustine’s wife was Anne Cutting for in his will he appoints his brother-in-law, Nicholas Cutting, as supervisor. There is, however, no reference to his sister Ellen Felton in his will. He became a Freeman of Great Yarmouth in 1621 in right of John Thrower his father. He is frequently mentioned as a merchant and some fifteen years after his sister went to New England he was chosen Bailiff of their native place. Ellen’s grandfather, another John Thrower died early in 1611 and was buried in the Chancel of St. Nicholas Church, an honor accorded only to those who had served the Town well. His will was dated 11 January, 1610-11 and proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury 4 April following. In it he mentions five daughters but no sons and one bequest is to “John Thrower my son-in-law and Margaret his wife, my daughter” which indicates that Ellen Felton’s father and mother were both Throwers and probably relations.

Benjamin is now the only one of the emigrants to Salem whose history at Great Yarmouth prior to his crossing the Atlantic has not been outlined. He was baptized at St. Nicholas Church 19 December, 1604, and became a Freeman of Great Yarmouth in right of his father 1 December, 1628. His marriage to Mary Storey took place 2 September, 1628. Three daughters were born to them before the emigration. Elizabeth the oldest was baptized 18 September, 1629 and buried on the 9th of the following October. Their twin daughters, Judith and Ruth were baptized 3 January, 1632-3 and Judith’s burial is recorded 14 July, 1633. Of Ruth no further trace was found.

This is briefly what was discovered in England about our ancestors the Feltons of Great Yarmouth. There were others of our family name in the nearby counties of Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex and while they may have been relatives of our Yarmouth Feltons, nothing was found to prove any actual connection. During the more than one hundred years when our Feltons were living at Great Yarmouth there were other

Feltons dwelling not far away at Playford in Suffolk and at Pentlow in Essex. Playford is about forty-five miles southwest of Great Yarmouth and in the vicinity of Ipswich the county town of Suffolk. Pentlow is a small parish in the extreme northern part of Essex and lies about sixty miles southwest of Great Yarmouth. The Feltons of Playford are very fully described in the Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archeology in the article entitled “Playford and the Feltons” by Lord Arthur Hervey, himself a descendant of the Felton family of that place. Lord Arthur connects the Feltons of Playford with the ancient line living at a much earlier date at Litcham in Norfolk and in Northumberland, although it must be confessed that there are many doubts as to this relationship. These Feltons of Playford were living there from early in the sixteenth century until the direct line became extinct on the marriage of Elizabeth Felton with John Hervey, first Earl of Bristol in 1695. The family was a distinguished one and Sir Henry Felton the then head of the Playford Feltons was made a Baronet in 1620 by King James I.

The Feltons of Pentlow who were probably of the same branch as those of Playford were seated at Pentlow from 1470 to 1570. They are of especial interest to us because in the little Parish Church at Pentlow there is a Felton tomb on which are several Felton Coats of Arms impaling the Arms of allied families and in each case the Felton Arms are differenced by a mullet. It will be recalled that the antiquarian Cole in describing the portrait of our relative Nicholas Felton, Bishop of Ely, says that the Felton Arms on this protrait were differenced by a mullet. Cole was a very careful and highly regarded antiquarian and it is hardly believable that he would have made this statement if the mullet did not appear upon the Bishop’s Coat of Arms. If Nicholas Felton used the mullet as a mark of difference and these Feltons of Pentlow also used it, there would seem to be a strong presumption of a relationship between the Pentlow Feltons and those of Great Yarmouth. There is in this Pentlow family a Robert of an age corresponding to that of Robert Felton of Great Yarmouth, our ancestor, but a careful search among all the authorities available failed to

54 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

prove the identity of these two Roberts. And until some clear proof is found we must not assume that our Great Yarmouth Feltons were connected with the Feltons of Pentlow. The latter are referred to in Lord Arthur Hervey’s Paper and in Morant’s “History of Essex” both of which should be read by those interested in the English Feltons.

Besides these two Felton families living not far away from Great Yarmouth there were others of our family name who appear as early as the reign of King Edward I. These more ancient Feltons were a very warlike race and distinguished themselves greatly in the wars along the Scottish Border during the reigns of Edward I, Edward II and Edward III, and in the campaigns of the Black Prince in France. Accounts of them may be found in the Histories of Northumberland, and in Bloomfield’s History of Norfolk, in Beltz’s Memorials of the Order of the Garter, in Froissard’s Chronicles, in Hollingshead’s History and elsewhere. Their story culled from these and other sources may be briefly told. The first Feltons who made themselves famous were two brothers, Sir Robert and Sir William de Felton, who according to the pedigree printed in Lord Arthur Hervey’s paper, were the sons of Robert de Felton or Fitz-Pagan and descendants of the Bertrams, Barons of Mitford in Northumberland; but according to the pedigree printed in the History of Northumberland, sons of Robert de Felton, a son of John LeStrange, of Knocking in Shropshire, and of Litchem in Norfolk. Sir Robert the elder of these two brothers was with King Edward I in Flanders in 1298 and at the battle of Falkirk in July of that year where the Scottish Army under Sir William Wallace was practically annihilated by the English. This Sir Robert left one son, Sir John de Felton, who inherited from his father the estates at Litchem in Norfolk and was in 1315 made Keeper of Alnwick Castle in Northumberland, one of the strongest and most important fortresses on the Scottish border. This Sir John probably left no male heirs, for the properties at Litchem seem to have come into the possession of Sir William de Felton, the younger brother of Sir John’s father. This Sir William became a very famous soldier in the service of King Edward I. He was engaged in that King’s campaigns against the Welsh which

# The Feltons in England and America

ended with the conquest of that country. Sir William was then placed by the King in command of Beaumaris Castle, one of the most important fortresses which Edward built to hold the Welsh in subjection. Later Sir William accompanied the English King, on his expedition into Flanders in 1286 and on their return was employed in important services by his sovereign. As a mark of royal favor he was given the custody of the lands and the disposition in marriage of the heir of Sir Gilbert de Middleton, a well-known Knight of the Scottish Border. A few years before, he had married a Northumberland heiress, Constance de Pontop. She died before 1295 leaving three daughters. In July, 1298 Sir William was with his brother, Sir Robert, at the battle of Falkirk in which his horse was killed, a loss made up to him by the King. In September, 1302, an agreement was made with Sir William to keep the town and Castle of Linlithgow, an important post between Edinburgh and Sterling, lately won from the Scots. This document is still in existence and to it is attached Sir William’s seal. Though broken and defaced this seal shows the passant lions of the Felton arms as we know them today. Sir William in 1312 was Sheriff of Northumberland and in 1316 Custodian of Bamburgh Castle still used as a residence and then one of the important fortresses in the vicinity of the Scottish Border. Sir William died before May, 1328, when the lands belonging to his first wife Constance de Pontop were divided among her three daughters. By his second wife, Eustancia, he had three sons and two daughters. Sir William had meanwhile acquired the important estate of Edlingham near the town of Felton, in Northumberland, and this estate was inherited by the oldest son, a second Sir William. Of the first Sir William’s two younger sons, John and Robert, little is known beyond their being mentioned as doing garrison duty in Scotland with their father in 1311 when they could have been little more than boys.

The second Sir William de Felton was born in April, 1299, and was twice married. By his first wife, whose name is not known, he had a son, a third Sir William, who became a celebrated soldier in the service of the Black Prince, in his campaigns in France and Spain, and was killed in a skirmish.

56  The Feltons in England and America

with the Spanish forces 20 March, 1367. This third Sir William seems to have left no male heirs. The second Sir William married, as his second wife, Isabel, daughter of Duncan, 10th Earl of Fife and his wife, Mary de Monthermer, granddaughter of King Edward I. In connection with this second marriage a romantic story is told. Sir William was appointed Isabel's guardian and she married him for pure love, renouncing all her titles and rights to any inheritance as a direct descendant of King Edward I. By this marriage there were at least three, perhaps four, sons who inherited from their mother the blood royal. Their father, the second Sir William, had in his lifetime been Constable of Roxburgh Castle and Sheriff of Northumberland in 1336 and Knight of the Shire in 1340. His will was made in September, 1358, and his inquisition post mortem was taken at Durham in the following February. Of the second Sir William’s sons by his second marriage the older, Sir John, succeeded to the Edlingham and other entailed estates on the death of his half brother, Sir William, in Spain. This Sir John was present at the battle of Otterburn in 1388 and was Sheriff of Northumberland in 1391. He died 31 March, 1396, leaving two daughters by his first wife, Joan, a daughter of Sir William Fitzwilliam and by his second wife, Elizabeth, a daughter of Sir John de Fenwick, an only son, Sir John de Felton who became Lord of Edlingham by inheritance. He was ten years old at his father’s death and became the ward of Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland. He died in February 1402-3, without any children.

But by far the most celebrated of these Felton warriors was Sir Thomas a son of the second Sir William de Felton by his second wife, Isabel. Sir Thomas was one of the most trusted lieutenants of the Black Prince in his famous campaigns in France and Spain. He was, in fact, through his mother, a blood relation of the Prince. A biography of this most distinguished of the Feltons may be found in the Dictionary of National Biography and in Beltz's “Memorials of the Order of the Garter.” He was Lord of the Manor of Litcham in Norfolk and Seneschal of Aquitaine and took part in the battles of Crecy and Poitiers. In January, 1381, he was made a Knight of the Garter, and the plate on which

## THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

his Coat of Arms is engraved is still to be seen in the stall occupied by him in St. George’s Chapel at Windsor. He died 26 April, 1381. By his wife, Joan Walkfare, he had three daughters but no sons.

The second Sir William, besides Sir John and Sir Thomas, left a son, Duncan, a priest, and perhaps a fourth son, Sir Edmund, from whom the pedigrees in Lord Arthur Hervey’s paper claim that the Feltons of Playford and Pentlow are descended. But Lord Arthur as already stated had serious doubts as to the connection and Peter Le Neve, a famous herald who lived in the latter part of the seventeenth century, and who was a devoted student of the history of Norfolk families, says that he never could find any authority for piecing the Playford family to the more ancient Feltons of Norfolk. There is much confusion regarding the relationship of these early Feltons to one another and the best authorities do not agree as to the lines of their descent. What has been said of them here and what may be found in the books referred to, will at least give some idea of the kind of men they were.

The Coat of Arms used with but slight variations by men of our name for more than six centuries is blazoned in heraldic terms thus—Gules, two lions passant Ermine, ducally crowned Or. In plain English these arms would be described in this way. On a red shield two lions walking toward the left side of the shield as we face it and with their right front paws raised, the lions being colored ermine and having upon their heads gold crowns such as dukes are accustomed to wear. Whether the Feltons lived at Great Yarmouth, Playford, Pentlow or Litcham in the Eastern Counties or in Northumberland on the Scottish Border they all bore these same arms, a fact which indicates that they at least claimed some common ancestor. That they had undoubted right to bear these arms cannot be questioned, for in England the use of unauthorized arms is a serious offense of which the Herald’s Office would have taken immediate notice.

It would be most satisfactory if we could connect our Yarmouth family with these earlier Feltons who distinguished themselves so valiantly in the service of their country. But until further investigations prove clearly and without the

58 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

shadow of a doubt that there was such a connection, we can be well content with our descent from the Feltons of Great Yarmouth. They were of fine old English stock and occupied no mean place in the England of their day.

# INTRODUCTION FROM THE BOOK OF CYRUS FELTON

This introduction is reprinted almost word for word from Cyrus Felton's original work; changes and additions having been made only where more recent investigations have made such changes and additions desirable.

Nathaniel Felton was the venerable patriarch of the family in Massachusetts, whose descendants are compiled in this genealogy. Nathaniel Felton came to Salem in 1633, when 18 years of age; he made a voyage to England in 1634, and returned to Salem in 1635; the next year, 1636, 20 acres were granted to his mother, Ellen Felton, and in 1637 two acres were granted to Nathaniel.

In 1643, he sold to William Brown, Sen., "The Lott south east of Rev. Mr. Skelton's Lott, with an old house upon it." About 1645, he settled near Felton Hill, Salem, the part afterwards called Danvers,—now Peabody. He said in 1700, he had lived there 55 years. Nathaniel Felton was a Juror in the following years: 1648, 1655, 1664, 1666, 1668, 1669, 1671 and 1674. He served on the Grand Jury in 1660, 1661, 1667, 1679 and 1680. He was on several occasions foreman of both the Petit and Grand Juries. Nathaniel Felton was given the title of Sergeant in 1669. In 1679 he was chosen Ensign and in 1681, Lieutenant. He became a member of the Church in 1648 and his two oldest children were baptized the same year. In 1649 he took the oath as Freeman. He was a Selectman in 1682.

He was witness to many wills, deeds, agreements, etc. Rev. Dr. Felt, author of annals of Salem, says, "He was a man of good faith and judgment. He was frequently called to give his testimony about litigated estates." In 1674, he was overseer and appraiser of the estate of his brother-in-law, Christopher Waller. In 1684, he was overseer and appraiser of Dr. Zerubbabel Endicott's estate, son of the then Gov. John Endicott.

60 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

Nathaniel Felton was overseer of several other estates. Besides those named above, he was an appraiser of the following estates: Rebecca Bacon in 1655; Ann Fuller in 1662; William Cantlebury in 1663; Henry Bullock in 1664; Thomas James in 1666; Ralph Tompkins in 1666; Richard Bishop in 1675; Henry Coleborne in 1676; Isaac Goodale in 1679; Isaac Gould in 1679; John Tompkins, Sen., in 1681; Edward Bridges in 1682; Thomas Goldthwaite in 1683; John Bowden in 1683; Edward Beacham in 1684; Thomas Rix in 1685; William Babb in 1691; probably this list is not complete.

The pretended trial of John Proctor, who was executed in the year of the witchcraft delusion, 1692, Nathaniel Felton and the neighbors living near the bounds of Salem Village presented the following paper, written by Nathaniel Felton the first signer.

“We, whose names are underwritten, having several years known John Proctor and his wife, do testify that we never heard or understood that they were ever suspected to be guilty of the crime now charged upon them; and several of us, being their near neighbors, do testify that, to our apprehension, they lived Christian like in their family, and were ever ready to help such as stood in need of help.”

“In the original paper, there were some, perhaps many names cut off by scissors,” says C. W. Upham’s History of Witchcraft. Below are the twenty names found on the paper:

Nathaniel Felton, Sen., and Mary, his wife.  
Samuel Marsh, and Priscilla, his wife.  
James Houlton, and Ruth, his wife.  
John Felton, Nathaniel Felton, Jr.  
Samuel Frayll, and Ann, his wife.  
Zachariah Marsh, and Mary, his wife.  
Samuel Endicott, and Hannah, his wife.  
Samuel Stone, George Locker.  
Samuel Gaskill, and Revidal, his wife.  
George Smith, Edward Gaskill.  

Lieut. Nathaniel Felton was a prominent, worthy and highly respected citizen.

His deposition of April 6, 1705, signed by his own hand, before John Higginson, Justice of the Peace, said he had been in Salem about 72 years. The same time he testified that

North River in Salem was called Naumkeag by the Indians; also, concerning the site of the old Indian settlement at Naumkeag.

“Nathaniel Felton’s wife was Mary Skelton a daughter of the Reverend Samuel Skelton first Minister of the First Church at Salem, Massachusetts. It is probably his baptism which is recorded on the Parish Register of Coningsby, Lincolnshire, England, on February 26, 1592-3 although this is by no means certain. Samuel Skelton died at Salem, August 2, 1634. His marriage on April 27, 1619 was found recorded at Sempringham, Lincolnshire to Susanna Travis who was baptized at Horbling, a Parish near to Sempringham on Sept. 11, 1597. She died at Salem, November 15, 1631. She was a daughter of William Travis whose home was at Horbling, the father’s death having occurred at Horbling early in 1635, his will being dated in April of that year. Skelton matriculated at Clare Hall, Cambridge, on July 7, 1608 as a Sizar. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree there in 1611 and became a Master of Arts of the same College in 1615. His first clerical duties were performed at Sempringham, Lincolnshire, of which Parish he was the incumbent until 1621. In the immediate vicinity of the old Sempringham Church, which is still standing, was a seat of the Earls of Lincoln which disappeared many years ago and here, no doubt, the association of Skelton with Theophilus, Fourth Earl of Lincoln, which was to be so important an influence in his career, began. On the Parish Register of Sempringham is recorded the baptism and burial of Samuel Skelton’s first child, Sarah, in August, 1621. He next appears at Tattersall, Lincolnshire, the principal seat of the Earls of Lincoln and not far distant from Sempringham. Here the Parish Registers record the baptisms of his son, Samuel, on January 8, 1622, and his daughters, Susanna on April 3, 1625, and Mary, the future wife of Nathaniel Felton on June 24, 1627. Skelton was not the incumbent at Tattersall and his duties there, in all probability, were those of House Chaplain to the Earl, who was one of the principal movers in the establishment of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and Skelton’s association with him at Sempringham and at Tattersall accounts for the choice of Skelton as Minister of the infant colony at Salem. A few years later in 1629 the Earl’s daughter, Arbella, and her husband, Isaac Johnson were to accompany John Winthrop on his emigration to New England on the ship “Arbella” named in her honor. Skelton must also have been in contact with John Endicott before the latter’s emigration for the records of the Massachusetts Bay Company state that Endicott “had formerly received much good from his ministry.” 

Edward Johnson speaks of him as “A man gratious of speech, full of faith and furnished by the Lord with Gifts from above.”

62 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

Little has been said about the Rev. Samuel Skelton by those contemporaries who wrote on clerical history. He differed about clerical associations and other subjects from many of those in Massachusetts, and the fact that he approved of Roger Williams who was at one time his assistant, goes to show that he was more in sympathy with the lenient than the austere of the Puritans.

In 1629, when Rev. Skelton was chosen as the first minister of the church, at Salem, Francis Higginson was chosen as teacher. In August, 1879, the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the First Church of Salem, the oldest church in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and the first society of the Congregational Order established in this country, was celebrated in that ancient town, incorporated, in 1836, a city. Mr. Higginson died the next year after he arrived in America, in August, 1630, in the 43d year of his age.

In 1929, the 300th anniversary of the First Church in Salem was celebrated. A special Sunday evening service was held on May 26th with a program of organ and violoncello music and a talk on "The First Church." At the service on the 28th, a paper was read on "The North Church" followed by an historical exhibition. On Sunday morning, June 2, Rev. Samuel Atkins Eliot, minister of Arlington Street Church, Boston, preached the sermon at the Third Century Service. The following morning there was a service of Commemoration of the beginning of Independence in America with the ministers of the earlier colonial churches present.

The colonial authorities granted to Rev. Mr. Skelton, for his sacrifice in leaving Old England, about 200 acres then in Salem, and was called "Skelton Neck," then New Mills, now Danversport.

Rev. Samuel Skelton's wife died March 15, 1631, leaving one son and three daughters; the three oldest having been born in England and the youngest in America. Winthrop's History of Massachusetts, says Mrs. Skelton was "a goodly and helpful woman; she lived desired and died lamented, and well deserves to be honorably remembered." Rev. Mr. Skelton died three years afterwards, August 2d, 1634.

The children of Rev. Samuel Skelton and his wife Susanna were:

i. Sarah, bapt. Aug. 12; bur. Aug. 27, 1621, Sempringham Parish Register.

ii. Samuel, bapt. Jan. 8, 1622, Tattersall; came to Salem with father, 1629; returned to England about 1649 and kept an inn at Tattersall; in 1649, supposed then of age, he sold his part of "Skelton Neck" to John Porter. A few years afterwards, his three sisters sold

# THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

their shares, 60 acres to the same man. Samuel Skelton, Jr. d. at Tattersall about 1663 when his will was made. His wife’s name was Margaret.

iii. **Susanna**, bapt. April 3, 1625, Tattersall. She was the 2d wife of John Marsh. They had several children. Mr. Marsh’s estate was settled in 1674; the widow, Susanna Marsh, m. 2d, Thomas Rix, whose estate was settled in 1685.

iv. **Mary**, bapt. Tattersall, Lincolnshire, England, June 28, 1627; m. Nathaniel Felton, Sen.; d. May 8, 1701. They lived husband and wife 56 or more years. Lieut. Nathaniel Felton d. 4 years afterwards, July 30, 1705, aged 90 years.

v. **Elizabeth**, b. Salem; m. Robert Sanford of Boston, where they lived and had several children.

Rev. Mr. Skelton’s two immediate successors were famous preachers, Rev. Roger Williams and Rev. Hugh Peter. Rev. Williams was educated at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge.

The name “Skelton” was preserved in the Felton family, as a Christian name for several generations.

**BENJAMIN FELTON**, an uncle of Nathaniel, came to America in 1635, when he was 31 years of age. He soon afterwards took the oath of a freeman. In 1636, he had 20 acres of land granted him. In 1637, Benjamin Felton had ten acres south side of Derby’s Fort. The following is found on record, dated October, 1636; “Whereas Benjamin Felton enioned, (enjoined) to send away Robert Scarlett for his misdemeanors, etc., but having hope of amendment is admitted so stay.” Benjamin Felton is called a farmer and turner by trade. He lived in Salem near the meeting-house, and in 1651, was chosen to take care of it. He probably had care of the house many years, for we find in “March, 1673, Benjamin Felton was chosen to ring the bell and to take care of the Meeting-house.”

In 1659, he purchased a dwelling, house and one quarter of an acre of land in Salem, for 12 pounds, of Charles Gott of Wenham, who was agent and attorney for the Rev. and famous Hugh Peter, a former pastor of the Salem Church.

64 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

He afterwards purchased more land in Salem of the same person. 

June 29, 1669, Benjamin Felton was appointed to keep the Salem prison. “He accepted the trust for one year, having as much an Mr. Wilson, the keeper of the Ipswich prison.” June 19, 1676, “Agreed with John Marston to move the prison into Benjamin Felton’s garden.” He kept the prison till 1684, when Jeremiah Rogers took charge of it. Mr. Rogers purchased some land of Mr. Felton near the meeting house, that Mr. Felton bought of Mr. Gott. Benjamin Felton was grand juryman in 1668; he was frequently called upon to witness deeds, etc. 

Mr. Savage (author of Early Settlers in New England) says Benjamin Felton’s wife, Mary Felton, was a sad burden to her husband. He died in 1688 aged 84 years. March 25th, 1689, John Bly received for digging graves for Goodman Felton and others one pound and one shilling. 

Benjamin and Mary (Storey) Felton’s children were:

i. ELISABETH, b. Great Yarmouth, 1629.
ii. JUDITH } twins, b. Great Yarmouth, 1632-3
iii. RUTH {

(4) JOHN FELTON, baptized December 26th, 1639; he lived in Salem, part of the time, up to about 1685. When John Felton resided in Salem, his cousin of the same name and about six years younger, was called John Felton, Jr. In few cases they were witnesses together. He probably left Salem in 1685.

(5) EXERCISE FELTON, was probably their daughter, and perhaps their oldest child. The following from Roxbury records: “The 22d of 3d month (May) 1659, Exercise Felton, a maid of Salem” was living in that place. In 1661, Joseph Miles was married to Mary Whelan; she died in 1663, all of Salem. Joseph Miles married 2d, the 7th of the 9th month (December 7th) 1664, probably 1663, by Major Hathorne, Exercise Felton all of Salem. Children were:

i. KATHERINE, b. November 5th, 1664.
ii. MARY, b. April 1st, 1666; probably d. young.
iii. SUSANNAH, b. October 7th, 1667.

# The Feltons in England and America

iv. Abigail, b. July 5th, 1669.  
v. Mary, again, b. March 27th, 1671.

(6) Remember Felton, baptized May 28, 1643; married October 1664, George Samon; he died in Salem, February 12, 1672. Children:  
i. Elizabeth.  
ii. Mary, b. March 16, 1668-9.  
iii. Susannah, b. May 30, 1670.  
iv. George, Jr., b. March 1st, 1672.

(4) Benjamin Felton, Jr., baptized February 18th, 1645-6; he died in 1668. Probably he married and had one or two children. In 1720 Benjamin Felton served by signing and sealing a deed, as one, of in place of one of the selectmen of Salem, with Jonathan Putnam, James Houlton, Jacob Manning, and J. Barton. We suppose the last named Benjamin Felton was son of the above named Benjamin Felton, and grandson of Benjamin Felton, Sen., of Salem.

Judith Felton was baptized at Great Yarmouth, England, November 28, 1621, where the records show that she was a sister of Nathaniel. The Records at Salem also prove that she married about 1644, John Ingersoll who was born in England about 1625. He was son of Richard Ingersoll and brother of Dea. Nathaniel Ingersoll, of Salem Village. John Ingersoll died in Salem in 1683, aged 58 years. His will dated November 20th, 1683, names his son, John, Jr., executor. Nathaniel Felton, his brother-in-law, appointed overseer, with the widow, Judith Ingersoll. Their children were:  
i. John, Jr., b. 12 of 7 month (Sept.), 1644; m. March, 1670, Mary Coombs; had 5 children.  
ii. Nathaniel, b. 2nd of 10 month (Dec.), 1647; m. in 1670 Mary Preston; had 2 children.  
iii. Ruth, b. 20 of 4 month (June), 1649; m. Richard Ropes, (or Rose); he deceased in 1684; left 2 sons and 2 daughters.  
iv. Richard, b. 1st of 7 month (Sept.), 1651; m. Sarah ___; had one child.  
v. Sarah, b. 38 of 6 month (August), 1655; m. David Ropes; had 6 children.

66  THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

vi. CAPT. SAMUEL, b. 6 of 8th month (Oct.), 1658; m. Sarah ___; had 5 children; their daughters: Sarah, Margaret, and Susannah Ingersoll. Capt. Samuel Ingersoll d. about 1695, and his widow Sarah Ingersoll, became the second wife of Philip English. Mr. English and his first wife were imprisoned in witchcraft times, 1692, but broke out of Boston prison and ran away, but returned soon after the delusion was over, and he was one of the selectmen of Salem, in 1700.

John and Judith Ingersoll's children occupied a series of houses on the west side of Daniels street, Salem, leading from Essex street to the harbor. John Ingersoll, sr., was a mariner.

MARGARET FELTON, youngest sister of Nathaniel Felton, a daughter of John and Ellen Felton, was baptized at Great Yarmouth, December 17, 1623. She married Christopher Waller. Her brother was witness to several of Mr. Waller’s deeds given between 1660 and 1670. In 1676, Nathaniel Felton was overseer of Mr. Waller’s estate, who left to Joseph Woodrow property when 21 years of age. Mr. Woodrow was taxed in Salem Village (now Danvers), in 1682. Mrs. Margaret Waller married before 1687, Robert Fuller, who was dismissed from Rehoboth church, to Salem first church in 1679. At Salem, March 12th, 1691, at a meeting of the committee appointed by the town, for ordering, disposing and building of seats in the meeting house, Lieut. Nathaniel Felton, Mr. Robert Fuller, and Jeremiah Meacham, sen., were assigned the seat behind the minister. Mr. Fuller and wife were living 1697.

MRS. ELLEN FELTON, the mother of Nathaniel, Judith, and Margaret Felton, probably arrived in Salem in 1635. She was a member of the Salem church before 1637. In 1636 and in 1637 she had twenty acres granted her, and 30 acres in 1639. In 1652, the 28th of the 11th month, "Ellen Felton sold to William Marston, one dwelling-house and 20 rods of land in Salem, near North River." 

The same year, 1652, the town of Salem granted Mrs. Felton and Christopher Waller four acres of meadow north side of Ipswich River.

THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

The name Nathaniel Felton has been quite common in few families. We have counted, including children, 20 Nathaniel Feltons and 8 Nathan Feltons. 

Three of Lt. Nathaniel Felton’s great-grandsons were named Nathaniel Felton, and each of them had a son, Nathaniel and a grandson Nathaniel. All three of the great-grandsons were born in Salem in 1714, 1723 and 1730, and in the part afterwards called Danvers, now Peabody. The one born in 1714, settled at Roxbury, Massachusetts, and lived 92 years and 9 months. The one born in 1723 settled on Felton Hill, now Peabody, Massachusetts. The one born in 1730, moved with his father and brothers to New Salem, Massachusetts.

The descendants of Lt. Nathaniel Felton continued to reside in Salem, that part called Danvers, then South Danvers, now 1885, Peabody. About 100 years after he settled in America. Most of them lived within a square mile, at places called Felton Hill or Mount Pleasant, and at Felton corner, sometimes called Feltonville. The “Felton School” is in Feltonville, town of Peabody. Between 1709 and 1725, John Felton and Daniel Felton, brothers, sons of Nathaniel Felton, Jr., settled at Marblehead. About 1740 a few Felton families moved into the interior and western part of the state, and built for themselves new homes, which were afterwards centers of family interest. Nathaniel Felton, the fourth of Salem, settled in Roxbury. His son, Dea. Joshua Felton, was a prominent man in that place. Jacob Felton settled in Marlborough in 1738, and afterwards his brother, David Felton, and their relative, Archelaus Felton. In 1762 David Felton removed to Perersham.

In 1740 Ebenezer Felton, of Salem, a carpenter, or housewright he was called, went into the wilderness of Salem Plantation, afterwards called New Salem, when he was 55 years of age, and was the most prominent person in the place. Deacon Felton, also a house-wright, had married a daughter of James Houlton, sen., of Salem. Many of their descendants are scattered over what was old Hampshire County, now Hampshire, Franklin and Hampden Counties, Massachusetts. 

In 1745 Skelton Felton and his son, Joseph Felton, settled

68 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

in Rutland, Mass., the part afterwards called Oakham. Joseph Felton's son, Captain Benjamin Felton, who was an officer during the revolutionary war and in several battles, settled in Brookfield, Mass.

The descendants of Lieut. Nathaniel Felton, in the New England progenitor and patriarch, are widely scattered over the United States, Canada, Mexico, and other foreign countries.

In regard to health and longevity in the Felton family race, there has been a large number of old people; we have a list of nearly 100 octogenarians, and about as many between 70 and 80 years of age. There are a few cases of remarkable longevity. About one dozen Feltons have lived to the age of our first ancestor in this country, 90 years. The oldest person found by Cyrus Felton in his researches was living in 1886, then aged 97 years, Mrs. Lydia Felton, widow of George W. Felton, of Petersham, Massachusetts. No. 507.

The foregoing was written by Cyrus Felton forty-seven years ago. I find in my records that the longevity referred to, continues about the same with the present day Feltons. I find none however who have lived to the age attained by Mrs. Lydia Felton, widow of George Webber Felton, who died in Clarksville, New Hampshire, at the age of ninety-eight years. Today I find John Baldwin Felton, of Aledo, Illinois, who celebrated his ninety-first birthday December 5, 1933, and Mrs. Elias Rawson Felton, of Milan, Ohio, who celebrated her ninety-first birthday December 11, 1933, and Asa Gilson Felton, of Norwalk, Ohio, who is past eighty-seven. It is also of interest that so many couples have lived to celebrate their Golden Weddings. There are living today about a score of couples who have been married fifty or more years. Mr. and Mrs. Asa Gilson Felton, of Norwalk, Ohio, celebrated their sixty-second wedding anniversary last October seventh and Mr. and Mrs. George A. Felton, of Edgar, Nebraska, their fifty-ninth on April 22, 1933.

"In 1629 six ships came over, and in June two of these brought the godly ministers Higginson and Skelton. The Governor, Endicott, set aside July 20, 1629, as a solemn day of humiliation for the choice of a teacher and pastor at Salem. Representatives from Plymouth were asked to attend as guests. Perhaps the

THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA 69

best account we have of the occasion is that of Morton. It was, I think, the most important public meeting that has ever been held in New England. The vote was solemnly taken, and Higginson was chosen teacher and Skelton pastor. Thus was organized the First Congregational Church in America. We sometimes forget that the little band of refugees who settled at Plymouth had no real church organized for some years. They were members of the church in Leyden in Holland, who had come to America, and their services were directed by Elder Brewster; but they still considered themselves members of the church in Holland and constantly expected that the pastor and the rest of the congregation would come over. Just how or when the Plymouth church really separated and organized itself, I cannot say, but it was certainly much later than 1629.

**THE NATHANIEL FELTON HOUSE**

Edited by Nathaniel Felton. In 1644, on Felton Street, Salem, Massachusetts.

This fine old structure reveals the charm of the early colonial period, when great attention was paid to the artistic effects afforded by neat and well-proportioned architecture. Among its many beauties are the deep-set windows characteristic of the period and the quaintness of the old doorways. The woods in the foreground play a leading part in the artistic effect of the building, and the old trees may be the only reminder of what things were like a hundred years ago.

Mr. Felton married 2nd, October, 1716, Jehoadan Ward, born March 1690-91, daughter of John and Jehoadan Ward, of Salem. Ebenezer Felton was one of the first settlers in New Salem, Massachusetts. He went there with his 5 sons in 1740. The minister in New Salem Plantation, Rev. Samuel Kendall, was ordained December 15, 1742, at a church organized that year. In November, 1742, Mr. Felton and wife were dismissed from Salem church to New Salem. Ebenezer Felton was the first deacon of the church, chosen in July, 1744, the church then voted to have communion once in two months. Dea. Felton was the first town clerk of New Salem and one of the selectmen the year it was incorporated, 1753. He was probably the patriarch and father of the new township. He was called of New Salem Plantation in 1740, when 55 years of age. He died in 1776, aged 90 years. Mrs. Felton probably lived several years after her husband’s decease. It is said the women of the first settlement were fit companions of the hardy men who settled New Salem. A gentleman reports a story, which is given in Holland’s “History of Western Massachusetts,” which he heard from the lips of the wife of the first deacon of the church in New Salem, of the following purport:

“On some occasion, all the men of the settlement were called twenty or thirty miles from home, into the valley of the Connecticut, and were obliged to be absent over night. At an early hour all the women, with the few children of the settlement, assembled in the fort for the night. With military strictness, they kept a watch, and about midnight, one of them discovered the enemy stealthily approaching the fort from different directions, and in considerable numbers. The ‘Commander-in-chief’ immediately called the roll of the men in the settlement, in a hoarse, masculine voice, and named some who had never existed. An answer was given to each name in a corresponding tone. She then commanded them to load and prepare to fire. Then followed a noise like the ramming down of cartridges, at which the Indians retired with all convenient speed. Their presence was verified the next day by the discovery of their tracks near the fort. There were many Indians in the vicinity but the settlers effectively guarded themselves against their depredations.”

138 The Feltons in England and America

The name of Felton, too, by many here,  
In reminiscence must be held most dear.  
One, our Town Clerk, for twenty-eight full years,  
A Selectman as long,—and for fifteen,  
A representative,—among compeers  
Highly respected, must have been, I ween,  
Worthy a place in our centennial song.  
Worthy a place in hearts that well him knew,  
For friends ne’er met him, but he kept them long,  
For his was humor, wit and wisdom too;  
His manners gentle, his affections strong,  
In Nature’s quiet gifts surpassed by few.  

Capt. Nathan and Lydia Felton had 5 children.

This homelike-looking tavern that served the public in the last century was called a "mini tavern," so small did it seem compared with larger establishments. It is maintained that when the Metropolitan Water District is completed, several of its neighbor houses will be extinguished if it is not.

He made camp beside a huge rock near the Raquette River using the side of the rock for one side of his shack. He cleared the land and built a tavern. It became very popular and distinguished people made it their headquarters on their way through the Adirondacks and often remained as permanent guests. It was the headquarters for large lumbering interests and a place where hunters flocked in the fall for "Uncle Am" to guide them. It was the only building for miles distant. His tables were noted for their venison dinners. Indian relics were numerous in the section and just recently while clearing for a state highway, a large tree was cut down and an Indian arrow found imbedded in the heart of it. Mr. Felton’s wife, a dainty little French woman, often hunted with him and today her son carries a wallet made from the hide of one of

the deer she killed. The new state highway to Lake Placid and Saranac Lake, two of America’s foremost playgrounds, pass this spot. One of Mr. Felton’s granddaughters says of her grandfather:

He was also a frequent contributor to the *North American Review* and the *Christian Examiner*, and the author of many articles in the *New American Encyclopedia*. He collaborated with Henry W. Longfellow in the latter's *Poets and Poetry of Europe*, writing the biographical notices in that work. Later Longfellow immortalized their friendship in a group of sonnets entitled *Three Friends of Mine* in the second of which the poet’s love and longing for his dead friend and companion are told in touching and beautiful words.

Between him and Charles Dickens there existed a close friendship and intimacy which began with the novelist’s first visit to the United States, was cemented when the American Scholar visited Dickens at his home in London and ended only with the former’s death.

He was given the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws by Amherst in 1848 and by Yale in 1860, was for many years one of the School Committee of Cambridge and a member of the Board of Education of the State of Massachusetts. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy and a Member of the Massachusetts Historical Society, and succeeded Rufus Choate as one of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution at Washington. His fellow Regent, Dr. Theodore D. Woolsey, President of Yale University, closes a Eulogy of him with these words:
“He was a man who by his industry and vigor of mind made himself; a man whose genial nature and social qualities created friends for him on every side; a man who to the highest attainments in one department, united in an uncommon degree a large and liberal acquaintance with the circle of knowledge; a man of fine tastes, of most kindly sympathies, of strict uprightness; a man who adorned his professorship by the best qualities of a teacher, and the mingled kindness and firmness of a wise disciplinarian, and who brought to the Presidential chair of Harvard the firm purpose to raise the standard of that ancient University to everything that was good and noble.”

When the first troops passed through Pennsylvania and Maryland in April, 1861, General B. F. Butler had interviews with President Felton and said, “I may have to sink or burn your boat.” “Do so,” replied Mr. Felton, and immediately wrote an order authorizing its destruction if necessary.

The exacting duties of his position caused a physical breakdown and compelled his retirement from active work. In 1865, he recovered his health and became President of the Pennsylvania Steel Company, a position which he held until his death. He was a director of many railroads and other organizations and was appointed in 1862 by Governor Andrew of Massachusetts one of the commission in charge of the construction of the Hoosac Tunnel, and by President Grant one of the commissioners to inspect the Pacific Railroads upon their completion. He was also a director of the Board of Finance which constructed and managed the Centennial Exposition of 1876. Mr. Felton died at Philadelphia, January 24, 1889, and is buried at Woodlands.

1325 GEORGE ALONZO FELTON (Alonzo7, William6, William5, Nathaniel4, Nathaniel3, John2, Nathaniel1), born July 21, 1850, at Franklin, Vermont; married April 22, 1874, at Eddyville, Iowa, to Anna M. Littrel, who was born August 24, 1856. The Felton homestead in Vermont was only one and one-half miles from the Canadian line and Mr. Felton relates of while a small boy watching his mother feed a negro man and wife and their two children, their home being the last station on the underground railroad. He moved with his family to Oberlin, Ohio, in 1866 and attended college two years. He worked at Bloomington, Illinois, two years and in 1870 he taught school at Ackley, Iowa. The following summer with his salary plus $100 given him by his mother he purchased an ox team and wagon and, following Horace Greeley’s advice, started west via Des Moines, Iowa, and St. Joseph, Missouri. He proceeded to the bank of the Republican River in the short grass country and states that “buffalo by the hundreds were in sight, but no hunters.” He backtracked seventy-five miles to the Oak Grove Ranch in the Little Blue River Valley. He selected a homestead on Oxbow Creek four miles west of the old Oregon Trail near the narrows of the Little Blue where the Indian massacre of 1865 had occurred. The nearest neighbors were four miles east and twelve miles west. George Felton’s first house was an

8 x 10 dugout with earth ends and back, and a log front with a door, and a window without glass. The following year he built a real 12 x 16 dugout with a dirt roof. In the fall of the year, he traveled east and worked at the old Hackney Ranch for a time to increase his grubstake. He returned in October to find the entire country swept bare by fire. This was on the same day as the Chicago fire. The only thing to do was to take his stock east out of the burned section for the winter. During the next few months he drove a freight team hauling supplies from the end of the railroad in Kansas to the wild six-house town of Meridian, next town to the west being Denver. Mr. Felton returned to his homestead in ’72, raised his first crop, and worked out again in the winter. In ’73 his sister Mary came west to keep house for him and a 16 x 20 log house with a shingled roof was erected and a good crop raised. In 1874, the year of his marriage, the grasshoppers came and ate every green thing. In 1893, a frame house succeeded the one of logs.

Mr. Felton helped to organize Nuckolls County, Nebraska, in 1871, when the poll of votes totaled forty-five. He likewise helped to organize schools and churches and represented his county in the State Legislature in 1891-3. He also helped organize Nuckolls County Farmers’ Mutual Insurance Company of which he served as President eleven years. Mr. and Mrs. Felton celebrated their 59th wedding anniversary in April of this year (1933). They live in Edgar, Nebraska, and as Mr. Felton states in a recent letter, he has no complaint to make—“Can eat all I want and sleep as long as they will let me.”

APPENDIX A  
EXTRACT FROM AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY WRITTEN BY  
SAMUEL MORSE FELTON FOR HIS  
CHILDREN IN 1866  

Early in the year 1861, Miss Dix, a Philanthropist, came into my office one Saturday afternoon. I had known her for some years as one engaged in alleviating the sufferings of the afflicted. Her occupation had brought her in contact with the prominent men of the South. In building Hospitals she had become familiar with the structure of Southern society and also with the workings of its political machines. She stated to me that she had an important communication to make to me personally and after closing my door I listened attentively to what she had to say. For more than

390 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

Seaford and then to the Chesapeake and up the Potomac to Washington or to Annapolis and thence to Washington. Another to Perryville and thence to Annapolis and Washington. Mr. Trist left that night and arrived in Washington at six the next morning which was on Sunday. He immediately had an interview with General Scott who told him he had foreseen the trouble that was coming and in October previous had made a communication to the President predicting trouble at the South and urging strongly the garrisoning of all Southern Forts and Arsenals with forces sufficient to hold them, but that his advice had been unheeded and nothing had been done and he feared nothing would be done, that he was powerless and he feared that Mr. Lincoln would be obliged to be inaugurated into office at Philadelphia. He should, however, do all he could to bring troops to Washington sufficient to make it secure but he had no influence with the administration and feared the worst consequences. Thus matters stood on Mr. Trist’s visit to Washington, thus they stood for sometime afterward. About this time, a few days subsequent, however, a gentleman from Baltimore came out to Back River Bridge about five miles this side of the City and told the Bridge keeper that he had come to give information which had come to his knowledge of vital importance to the Road and which he wished to communicate to me. The nature of this communication was that a party was then organized in Baltimore to burn our Bridges in case Mr. Lincoln came over the Road or in case we attempted to carry troops for the defense of Washington. The party had combustible materials then prepared to pour over the Bridges and were to disguise themselves as negroes and be at the Bridge just before the train in which Mr. Lincoln was, had arrived. The Bridge was then to be burned and the train attacked and Mr. Lincoln be put out of the way. This man appeared to be a gentleman and in earnest and honest in what he said, but he would not give his name nor allow any inquiry to be made as to his name or exact abode as he said his life would be in peril were it known that he had given this information, but if we would not attempt to find him out he would continue to come and give information. He came subsequently several times and gave items of infor-

# Appendix A

mation as to the movements of the conspirators but I have never been able to ascertain who he was. Immediately after the development of these facts I went to Washington and there met one of our Directors from Baltimore who was well acquainted with Marshall Kane, then the Chief of Police. I was anxious to ascertain whether he was loyal and reliable and made particular inquiries upon both these points. I was informed that he was perfectly reliable. Whereupon I made known some of the facts that had come to my knowledge in reference to the designs of burning of the Bridges and requested that they should be laid before Marshall Kane with a request that he should detail a Police force to make the necessary investigations. Marshall Kane was seen and it was suggested to him that there were reports of a conspiracy to burn the Bridges and cut off Washington and his advice was asked as to the best way of ferreting out the conspirators. He scouted the idea that there was any such thing on foot. Said he had thoroughly investigated the whole matter and there was not the slightest foundation for such rumors. I then determined to have nothing more to do with Marshall Kane but to investigate the matter in my own way and at once sent for a celebrated detective who resided in the West and whom I had before employed in an important matter. He was a man of great skill and resource. I furnished him with a few hints and at once set him on the track with eight assistants. Men were then drilling upon the Line of the Railroad some three military organizations professedly for home defense, pretending to be Union and in one or two instances tendering their services to the Railroad in case of trouble. Their propositions were duly considered but the defense of the Railroad was never entrusted to their tender mercies. The first thing done was to enlist a volunteer in each of these military companies. Apparently they came from New Orleans and Mobile and did not appear to be wanting in sympathy for the South. They were furnished with uniforms at the expense of the Railroad Company and drilled as often as their associates in arms, became initiated into all the Secrets of the organizations and reported every day or two to their Chief who immediately reported to me the designs and plans of the Companies.

392 The Feltons in England and America

One of these military organizations was loyal but the other two were disloyal and fully in the plot to destroy the Bridges and march to Washington to wrest it from the hands of the legally constituted authorities. Every nook and corner on the Road and its immediate vicinity was explored by the Chief and his detectives and the secret workings of deception and treason made bare and brought to light. Societies were joined in Baltimore and various modes known to and practiced only by detectives resorted to, to win the confidence of the conspirators and get into their secrets. The plan worked to a charm and the midnight plottings and the daily consultations of the conspirators were treasured up as a guide to our future plans for thwarting them. It turned out that all that had been communicated by Miss Dix and the gentleman from Baltimore rested upon a foundation of fact and that the half had not been told. It was made as certain as strong circumstantial and positive evidence could make it that there was a plot to burn the Bridges and destroy the Road and murder Mr. Lincoln on his way to Washington if it turned out that he went there before troops were called. If troops were first called, then the Bridges were to be destroyed and Washington cut off from the North and taken possession of by the South. I at once organized and armed a force of about two hundred men, whom I distributed along the Line between the Susquehanna and Baltimore, principally at the Bridges. These men were drilled regularly by drill masters and were apparently employed in whitewashing the Bridges putting on some six or seven coats of wash saturated with salt and alum to make the outside of the Bridges as nearly fireproof as possible. This whitewashing so extensive in its application became a nine days wonder of the neighborhood. Thus these Bridges were strongly guarded and a train was arranged so as to concentrate all the forces at one point in case of trouble. The programme of Mr. Lincoln was changed and it was decided by him that he would go to Harrisburg from Philadelphia and thence over the Northern Central Road by day to Baltimore and thence to Washington. We were then informed by our detective that the attention of the conspirators was turned from our Road to the Northern Central and that they would there

APPENDIX A

await the coming of Mr. Lincoln. This statement was confirmed by our Baltimore gentleman who came out again and said their designs upon our Road were postponed for the present and until we carried troops would not be renewed again. Mr. Lincoln was to be waylaid upon the Line of the Northern Central Road and in Baltimore and prevented from reaching Washington and his life was to fall a sacrifice to the attempt. Thus matters stood on the afternoon of his arrival in Philadelphia. I felt it my duty to communicate to him the facts that had come to my knowledge and urge his going to Washington privately that night in our Sleeping Car instead of publicly two days after as was proposed. I went to a Hotel in Philadelphia where I met the detective who was registered under an assumed name and arranged with him to bring Mr. Judd, Mr. Lincoln’s intimate friend, to my room in season to arrange for the journey to Washington that night. One of our detectives made three efforts to communicate with Mr. Judd while passing through the streets in the procession and was three times arrested and carried out of the crowd by the Police. The fourth time he succeeded and brought Mr. Judd to my room where he met the detective-in-chief and myself. We lost no time in making known to him all the facts that had come to our knowledge in reference to the conspiracy and I most earnestly advised that Mr. Lincoln should go to Washington privately that night in the Sleeping Car. Mr. Judd fully entered into the plans and said he would advise Mr. Lincoln to adopt it. On his communicating with Mr. Lincoln after the services of the evening were over, he answered that he had engaged to go to Harrisburg and speak the next day and he would not break his engagement even in the face of such peril, but that after he had performed the engagement he was under at Harrisburg he would follow such advice as we might give him in reference to his journey to Washington. It was then arranged that he should go to Harrisburg the next day and make his address, after which he was to apparently return to Governor Curtin’s house for the night, but in reality go to a point about two miles out of Harrisburg where an extra car and engine awaited to take him to Philadelphia. At the time of his retiring the Telegraph Lines East, West, North

394 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

and South from Harrisburg were cut so that no messages as to his movements could be sent off in any direction. Mr. Lincoln could not arrive in season for our regular train that left at 11 P.M. and I did not dare send him by an extra for fear of its being found out or suspected that he was on the Road and it became necessary for me to devise some excuse for the delay of the train, but three on the Road besides myself knew the plan. One of them I sent to Baltimore by an earlier train to say to the people on the Washington Branch Road that I had an important package I was getting ready for the 11 o’clock train, that it was necessary that I should have this package delivered in Washington early the next morning without fail, that I was straining every nerve to get it ready by 11 o’clock P.M. for the train but in case I did not succeed I should delay the train till it was ready, probably not more than half an hour and I wished as a personal favor that the Washington Train should await the coming of our Train from Philadelphia before leaving. This request was willingly complied with by the managers on the Washington Branch and the man whom I had sent to Baltimore so informed me by telegraph in cypher. The second person on the Road in the secret I sent to West Philadelphia with a carriage to await the coming of Mr. Lincoln. I gave him a package of old Railroad Reports done up with great care with a great seal attached to it and directed in a firm round hand to a person at Willard’s and marked very important, to be delivered without fail by 11 o’clock Train and using my own name upon the package. Mr. Lincoln arrived in West Philadelphia and was immediately taken into the carriage and driven to within a square of our station when my man with the package jumped off and waited till he saw the carriage driven up to the door and Mr. Lincoln and the detective get out and go in. He then came up and gave the package to the conductor who was waiting at the door to receive it, in company with a Police Officer. Tickets had been bought before hand for Mr. Lincoln and party to Washington, including a tier of berths in the Sleeping Car. He passed between the Conductor and the Police Officer at the door and neither suspected who he was. The Conductor remarked as he passed “Well old fellow, it is lucky for you

Appendix A 395

that our President detained this Train to send a package by it or you would have been left.” Mr. Lincoln and the detective being safely ensconced in the Sleeping Car and my package safely in the hands of the Conductor the train started for Baltimore about fifteen minutes behind time. Our man number three, George——, started with the Train to go to Baltimore and hand it over with its contents to man number one who awaited its arrival in Baltimore. Before the Train reached Gray’s Ferry Bridge and before Mr. Lincoln had resigned himself to slumber the conductor came to our man, George, and accosting him said, “George, I thought you and I were friends and why did you not tell me we had old Abe on board.” George, thinking the Conductor had in some way become possessed of the secret answered, “John, we are friends, and as you have found it out, old Abe is on board, and we will still be friends and see him safely through.” John answered, “Yes, even if it cost me my life he shall have a safe passage” and so George stuck to one end of the car and the Conductor to the other every moment that his duties to the other passengers would admit of it and Mr. Lincoln did have a safe passage. It turned out, however, that the Conductor was mistaken in his man. A person strongly resembling Mr. Lincoln had come down to the Train about half an hour before it left and bought a ticket to Washington with a ticket for the Sleeping Car. The Conductor had seen him and concluded he was the veritable Old Abe. George delivered the Sleeping Car and Train over to William in Baltimore, and William, as had been previously arranged, took his place at the brake and rode to Washington where he arrived on the rear of the Sleeping Car at about six A.M. on time and saw Mr. Lincoln in the hands of a friend safely delivered at Willard’s, when he secretly ejaculated, “God be praised.” He also saw my package of Railroad Reports marked “highly important” delivered safely into the hand for which it was intended. This being done he performed his morning ablutions in peace and quiet and enjoyed with unusual zest a breakfast at Willard’s. At eight o’clock, the time agreed upon the Telegraph wires were joined and the first message flashed across the Lines was “Your package has arrived safely and been delivered

396 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

William." Then there went up from the writer of this a shout of joy and a devout thanksgiving to Him from whom all blessings flow, and the few who were in the secret joined in on a heartfelt Amen.

## The Feltons of New Virginia, Iowa

John Felton was born in 1805 in Preston County, Virginia, the third child of John and Mary (McHenry) Felton. He married Margaret Wotring and moved to Warren County, Iowa, in 1854 and helped to lay out the town of New Virginia, Iowa, in 1856. Ten children were born to this union. A grandson, E. H. Felton, is Chairman of the Iowa Board of Control. Many of this branch of Feltons have lived in that section of Iowa, and each year hold a reunion to which the compiler of this book has often been invited. Mr. E. H. Felton states that his father, "Zachariah Felton lived for seventy years, until he died September 10, 1923, on the same acre to which his grandfather came, in 1854 and which is still held in the Felton name."

## The German Felton Family of Pennsylvania

Cyrus Felton in his "Felton Book" states that most of the Pennsylvania Feltons are of German Lineage. They spelled the name both Felton and Felten. The compiler of this genealogy has had considerable correspondence with members of this family of Feltons. Lloyd D. Felton, a member of the faculty of the Harvard Medical School, writes me that "a few generations ago our family of Feltons lived in Philadelphia and one Jacob Felton was a merchant in Western Pennsylvania. He was the father of four or five sons, one of whom was my father, Anthony Karns Felton. I am the only male descendant of Anthony Karns.

"I have been told by some of my relatives that the Felton family of Philadelphia was of German origin and that the family in Germany was Valentine and was changed to Felton by two brothers who emigrated to Philadelphia very early in that city’s history."

Cyrus Felton in his genealogy mentions calling on eight of these Feltons in 1876.

The Revolutionary War records of New York list several members of this family, some spelled with an “e” and others with an “o.”

I have found many Feltons who trace their lines to the Felton family of one Richard Felton who arrived in Surry Co., Virginia, on or before 1670 from England.

# Appendix B

A certificate granting Lt. Col. George Jordan 1900 acres was issued for the importation of thirty-eight persons including: 

" Myself, 2 arrivals, William Jordan and Anna his wife, Mrs. Eliza Jordan, Mrs. Fortune Flood, Richard Felton, Robert Lee, John Gary" and others.

Richard Felton married and had a son Richard, who lived with Gov. Samuel Stephens of North Carolina in 1670. This son Richard married and had a son, Richard Felton 3rd, who became the ancestor of all the North Carolina Feltons. He was born in 1700 and died in 1776, will made of record in Chowan Co., North Carolina, November 5, 1776. He married about 1735 Ann Harrell. They had ten children: William, Noah, Elisha, Shadrach, Cadar, John, Ann, Sarah, Mary, and Chloe.

The second child Noah, also married a Harrell and their second child Job went to Georgia in 1785. He had one son John (1790-1870), wife Mary. Their only child was Dr. William Harrell Felton who was born in 1823. He graduated from the University of Georgia and from the Medical College and practiced for a time. Early in life he was ordained a minister in the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. He served in Congress from 1875 to 1881. His widow, Rebecca Latimer Felton, was the first United States woman Senator, serving for two days. (November 21 and 22, 1922.)

Noah Felton's third son, Samuel, was a Corporal in the Revolutionary War, 1782, 10th Regiment.

Richard 3rd's third son, Elisha, had son Gen. Boone Felton who served in the War of 1812. He served in the North Carolina State Assembly from 1800 to 1817 and in the State Senate until his death in 1821. He was the most prominent of the North Carolina Feltons up to that time.

Descendants of the Noah Felton family have been located at Bear Paw, and Billings, Montana; Los Angeles, California; York, and Lincoln, Nebraska; St. Louis, Missouri; and Coffeyville and Hays, Kansas; Floydada, Texas, and numerous other places in the United States.

The Feltons in England and America  

**Capt. William Trask and Some of His Descendants**  
By William Blake Trask, Boston: Press of David Clapp & Son, 1904, tracing the descent of Mary Trask, wife of Joseph Felton (Skelton3, Nathaniel2, Nathaniel1) [No. 76 in Cyrus], from Captain William Trask, "the Miles Standish of the Massachusetts Bay Colony," who was her great grandfather.  

Capt. William Trask, who came to this country as early as 1628, was one of the founders of Salem, and closely identified with the growth and development of its early settlement. His services in civil, military and church affairs are fully given in his biographical sketch, in the *New England Historical and Genealogical Register*, Vol. 53: pp. 43-53. His wife, whose name was Sarah, was living at the time of his death in 1666. Children: Sarah, Mary, Susanna, William, John, Eliza.  

William Trask, son of William and Sarah Trask, was baptized in the First Church in Salem, 19 Sept. 1640. He married (1) 18 Jan., 1666, Ann, daughter of Lieut. Thomas and Ann (Holyoke) Putnam, of Salem. She was born in Lynn, 25 Aug. 1645, and died in Salem, 14 Nov., 1676. His second wife was Anna.  

He resided in his native town and followed the trade of miller. He was a soldier in Philip's War, and for his services his heirs received a grant of land in Narragansett No. 3, Sonhegan West, now the town of Amherst, N. H.  

Prior to 1682, he erected a new house with a massive oak frame, "a relic of the aboriginal forest." It has been a family tradition for 200 years that the house was built in 1680, and that it was called the "Black Horse Tavern" from the sign of a black horse which it bore. In 1690, William Trask was recommended for innkeeper, and the house remained as an inn until about 1740. In 1752, that part of Salem was set off to Danvers, and the house was occupied by his descendants until within thirty years, Isaac Bullock, the son of Isaac and Martha (Trask) Bullock, being the last.  

Children by 1st wife: Hannah, Elizabeth, Sarah, William, Susanna.  
Children by 2nd wife: John, Elizabeth, Mary, George.

He resided in Salem, where he was born, and of which town he was a good citizen. Like his father, he lived in the “Black Horse Tavern,” where as host he was attentive to the wants of the traveller; and, like his grandfather, he carried on the old mill, which had been in the family from the beginning. He engaged in various enterprises, and his name frequently appears in the transfers of property. He was respectively styled “Inn-holder,” “husbandman,” “miller,” and “yeoman” in the deeds which he executed. He died intestate in 1737.

Children (all by 1st wife): William, John, George, Elizabeth, Edward, Hannah, Sarah, Mary, James, Samuel.

Feltons appear to have done their full share in the defense of our country in all its wars.  
Thirty-eight Feltons served in the War of the Revolution.  
Five are listed as fighters in the War of 1812.  
In going over the war rolls of the Civil War, I notice fifty-seven Feltons fighting though probably more were enlisted.  
In the World War more than seventy Feltons were engaged. A nephew of the author, Phil Felton, of Armour, South Dakota (Number 1946), endured the horrors of the Lost Battalion.  
Feltons have served in every branch: Army, Navy, and Aircraft forces; and the Felton services on Draft Boards, Red Cross, and Bond drives, and Committees of Correspondence in Revolutionary times, were great in numbers and efficiency.

The "Old Academy," founded in 1785, had a long and useful career, and was the Alma Mater of many Feltons.

## Migration

The Feltons seem to have liked Salem, in truth a fine old town then, a pleasing city now. Cyrus Felton in "The Felton Family" records the fact of all the Feltons remaining in and about Salem town for one hundred years or thereabouts. I mention this to indicate a phase of New England life of those days, and possibly a family trait of the Feltons of "staying put."

But in time the pioneer spirit developed; our people made the great venture of a trek of a hundred miles or so to the Connecticut River Valley. Such a move involved weeks, perhaps months, certainly a longer time than it took me to roll along beautiful highways to New Salem last year. They called the town which David Felton established "New Salem" because of their loyalty to the old town down along the coast. The name was well deserved and worthily bestowed: New Salem it is to this day, and a most pleasing village. I had the happy experience of visiting New Salem in 1933, the occasion being a home coming and celebration of the town's 193rd birthday. But I found few Feltons, only Charles Felton of Orange, Massachusetts, and myself to represent the family name.

Nearly two hundred years have passed since the days of the dense forests found there by the Feltons in 1740. They and their neighbors cleared those forests, laid out farms, and built homes flanked by the fine orchards and gardens, and even flower gardens, that our people knew.

But a change came: our Felton folk, along with their fellows, were lured to the westward and in spots diligent Mother Nature has worked as a reforester. I myself have seen great trees growing from cellar pits, trees possibly a century old.

Our people went west: that is, the majority of them joined in the migration that occurred closely following the Black Hawk War. Before that time numbers had ventured "away out west" to points in Ohio, such as Coshocton, Huntington, Norwalk, and other places, but the conclusion of the Indian Wars of the 50's saw a determined migration to the wide...

404 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

expanse of prairies beyond the Mississippi; nor did they stop there, the Felton spirit leading them through all the great West to California and to Oregon.  
And now in 1934, I, a Felton of the prairies of Iowa and the West, send greetings to all of the clan wherever they may be. Some remain in Massachusetts, wisely, I think when I reflect on the charm of the New England landscape; some are dwellers along the Pacific shores; some live north and others south. To all these good folk, “kin” I hope to call them, I send this message of fraternal regard.

Peabody Institute Narrative  
a noteworthy event  
“In 1629 six ships came over, and in June two of these brought the godly ministers Higginson and Skelton. The Governor, Endicott, set aside July 20, 1629, as a solemn day of humiliation for the choice of a teacher and pastor at Salem. Representatives from Plymouth were asked to attend as guests. Perhaps the best account we have of the occasion is that by Morton. It was, I think, the most important public meeting that has ever been held in New England. The vote was solemnly taken, and Higginson was chosen teacher and Skelton pastor. Thus was organized the First Congregational Church in America. We sometimes forget that the little band of refugees who settled at Plymouth had no real church organized for some years. They were members of the church in Leyden in Holland, who had come to America, and their services were directed by Elder Brewster; but they still considered themselves members of the church in Holland and constantly expected that the pastor and the rest of the congregation would come over. Just how or when the Plymouth church really separated and organized itself, I cannot say, but it was certainly much later than 1629.”

## THE SAMUEL M. FELTON RESOLUTION

Philadelphia, No. 308 Walnut Street,  
April 17th, 1865

At a meeting of Citizens of Philadelphia and its vicinity held on the 17th day of April, 1865, Mr. John Welsh was called to the Chair, and Thomas Kimber, Jr., appointed Secretary. The following Preamble and Resolutions were on motion unanimously adopted, and ordered to be published in the journals of the city.

Whereas, It is now publicly announced that Mr. Samuel M. Felton,—who, for many years has so ably presided over the Philadelphia, Wilmington & Baltimore Rail Road Company, and who, during the long and painful ordeal of our Civil strife, has, in that capacity, so eminently and faithfully discharged every duty to his Country and to this community, as well as to the special interests in his care,—has recently been obliged to retire from that important position, and to withdraw from all public duties:—

And Whereas, It is well understood that rapidly failing health, the result of too great a pressure of anxiety and care imposed upon him during the late public emergency, is the cause of his retirement:—and it is not deemed fitting that so prominent and useful a citizen should, under such circumstances, pass unnoticed and unhonored into the shades of private life:—

And Whereas, It is a matter of official record, authenticated beyond a question, and attested by many, now participating in these proceedings, that to Mr. Felton, more than to any other man, is due the credit of successfully opening the Annapolis Route to Washington in April, 1861; a measure which contributed so essentially to the preservation of our National Capital, after the destruction of the southern portion of his Road by the Baltimore Secessionists:

And Whereas, It was, as we have the strongest reason to believe, mainly owing to the vigilance, energy and skill of Mr. Felton that the plot to assassinate President Lincoln, on his way to the National Capital, in February, 1861, was discovered and frustrated:—a crime, the blackest in our

406 THE FELTONS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA

annals, which has at length been unhappily consummated, and has filled the land with mourning:—
And Whereas,—We cherish in grateful remembrance the unswerving fidelity and untiring and watchful zeal, with which, not only in these important instances, but through all the earlier stages of the present great Rebellion, Mr. Felton guarded the honor and interests of his Country, holding all other interests subservient to these; as was shown in his memorable and courageous response to those deluded men, who threatened the utter destruction of the property in his charge, if he continued to transport the National troops— and which we wish here to record:—
“The time has come,” said he, on the 17th of April, 1861, “when there must be only two classes recognized in this country, Union Men and Disunion Men. For myself I do not hesitate to decide upon my duty in this trying hour; it is to stand by the Government and abide the consequences. I shall therefore endeavor to do, to the best of my ability, what is required of me. . If our Road is disabled, the responsibility must rest upon the wicked persons, who do the deed, and a terrible retribution certainly will await them.”
And Whereas—While thus devoting his utmost energies to the service of his Country, it is well known that Mr. Felton determined at the outset of this war neither to accept for himself nor ask for a friend, a Government contract or office, or any pecuniary advantage, in order that he might more disinterestedly discharge his public duties; to which resolution he has faithfully adhered throughout the whole term of his office.

It is therefore Resolved, That the Citizens of Philadelphia have heard with deep concern and regret that Mr. Samuel M. Felton has been obliged to relinquish the important position he has so long held with honor before our Country, and in this Community: and they earnestly trust, that, under the blessing of Providence, his health may be restored by the opportunity of rest and relaxation, now afforded him, from his arduous duties.

Resolved, That in commemoration of these eminent public services and virtues, a Committee of gentlemen be appointed,

# Appendix B

including the officers of this meeting, to prepare and present to Mr. Felton a suitable service of silver plate as a testimonial of our admiration and regard.

Resolved, That a Record of the proceedings of this meeting, and the accompanying Resolutions, be appropriately engrossed on parchment, signed by its officers and the above mentioned Committee, and also presented to Mr. Felton on its behalf.

On motion, Edward W. Clark, Esq., was appointed Treasurer of the fund proposed to be raised for the purpose above mentioned.

The Chairman having announced the following Committee, on motion the meeting adjourned.
